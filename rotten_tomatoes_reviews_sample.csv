Freshness,Review
rotten," The muddled mental states of the characters (and that of the audience) are mirrored by the film's visual style, which oscillates between languorous dreamscapes and frenetic action sequences."
fresh," The Big Wedding is an occasionally charming and, overall, strangely watchable variation in the dysfunctional wedding comedy subgenre."
fresh," While 'Captain Phillips' is certainly a thrilling, compelling and exceptionally well-made movie in its own right, it doesn't make it to the next level without Hanks."
rotten," A more mean-spirited and tongue-in-cheek B-movie than its predecessors, closer in proudly ""politically incorrect"" spirit to something that East Coast grindhouse rival Troma might vomit out."
fresh," It's easy to poke fun at some of the more far-fetched scenes and, at times, cheesy dialogue, but this is still one hell of an action movie."
rotten," This is a superficial film, a condensation of an entire season of a TV sitcom."
rotten," About the only good call in The Girl on the Train was the casting, which gives us two hours of Emily Blunt shredding her soul, soaking it in vodka, and then setting it on fire. The rest is a mawkish, retrograde misfire."
fresh," The Drop is the last film Gandolfini made before his death. As send-offs go, it ain't too shabby."
fresh," It's sweet and superficial, but the meandering pace and lively characters make it just about watchable."
fresh," Technically, artistically and emotionally, this is a topflight British offering."
fresh, Wild is Cheryl Strayed's trip of self-discovery. It is getting an Oscar buzz for Reese Witherspoon. She's good but Laura Dern's work as Strayed's mom is much more deserving.
rotten," While the performances are strong in this coming-of-age drama, it suffers from being too familiar and predictable, with wobbly, hand-held camerawork continually breaking the storytelling's spell. "
fresh," The Matrix Reloaded is not the end all be all of movies. Nothing is. But it's great. It out-Matrixes the original Matrix with its fight scenes, car chase and philosophical insight."
fresh, Even merely very good Stephen Chow makes you realize how little joy emanates from most of Hollywood's outsized blockbusters.
fresh," An attempt to highlight just how unjust is the ""Land of Freedom"". [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten, Any hope of sneaky commentary or ironic appropriation of porn's tawdry incompetence disappears long before Deen's pants. 
fresh," It's a thinking person's teen flick, a feel-good film that earns its earnestness. It's got the-little-film-that-could spirit that could see it succeed like Little Miss Sunshine, but for my money it's the better of the two..."
rotten, Blended could well be Coraci and Sandler's most abject collaboration to date.
rotten," Importation of modern sensibilities into olden times is the gimmick, but now and then, MacFarlane forgets himself and just has fun. Once or twice, he even seems to feel something."
rotten, 'The Eagle' will likely find a future life on the video shelves of high school history teachers looking for a semi-educational way to kill a couple of days worth of classes.
rotten," The film could have worked if it had embraced the illicit fantasy at its core... But Aniello shies away, never finding a tone that would allow her to fuse edgy black comedy with the genre's mandatory celebration of female friendship."
rotten," The movie's hot, bathed in an erotic glow, but horribly empty."
fresh, A very moving heartfelt film.
rotten," While The Pyjama Girl Case follows the usual giallo patterns...Mogherini's dialogue and character development leave a lot to be desired, and his direction favours interesting compositions over cohesive storytelling. "
fresh," A little stylised, but still a genuinely creepy tale worth watching."
fresh, Rourke's mesmerising performance is the heart and soul of an existential exploration of self-definition locked on a sports flick.
rotten," The problem is, that half the time I laughed myself silly, while the other half, I was egregiously offended."
fresh, The King's Speech is the kind of production that makes you ask: why can't every film be made this way?
rotten," For the most part, the actors never sync up with Luhrmann's jitterbug rhythm."
rotten," Aiming for mass appeal, 'Risen' falls short of its target. "
fresh, Disobedience provides a sensitive portrait of immigration by showing the precise ways returnees can feel like foreigners in places that were once their homes... But other beats are delivered with the subtlety of a sledgehammer.
fresh," Eco-terrorism drives the plot of The East, but this propulsive thriller is laced with a humanism that trumps any political agenda."
rotten, Lisa Immordino Vreeland's avoidance of a serious analytical bent ends up stifling the documentary.
rotten," A Nashville wannabe without Robert Altman's subtle wit, Bobby is an ambitious attempt by writer-director Emilio Estevez to capture a turbulent era through a single historic event."
rotten, Excruciating stuff.
rotten, It's intriguing material that [screenwriter Brian] Helgeland offers but so insistent on condemnation and vast conspiracy theories that we lose an authentic sense of damage.
fresh, A breezily paced car chase film that does exactly what it says on the label.
fresh," By turns trashy, poignant and gut-bustingly funny, and often all three at once. "
rotten," Wondering what's real and what's just a carefully crafted crock doesn't make ""Scotty and the Secret History of Hollywood"" a better experience. It makes it a little pointless and frustrating."
rotten," Everyone involved, including the audience, deserves a better movie than this, and for fans of the book, it's possible some out there might not find the film version a disappointment, but like everything else in ""Dark Places"" that seems unlikely. "
fresh," It is odd, unsettling and told with humour so dark you are not sure whether to howl with laughter or take grave offence. It is also a mournful reflection on the search for hope in a world conspiring to make such a quest a foolâ(TM)s errand."
fresh," The deadly sins of envy, lust and salacious gossip in deepest rural England provide the motor for Stephen Frears's black romp, featuring vivacious former Bond girl Gemma Arterton in the title role of the youthful scribe."
fresh," Ambitious and slightly lengthy, the film presents a sequence of events that, though in hindsight a bit of a muddle, leaves an unforgettable impression of a fascinating couple."
rotten, There's just not enough there to sustain interest.
fresh," The accents may be difficult, but the message is clear."
fresh, an elegant and illuminating work
rotten," The film unfortunately depicts black female sexuality, a topic rarely portrayed onscreen, with all the depth and subtlety of a late night Cinemax offering."
rotten," So convoluted that its protagonists have to regularly stop and shout out what ""must"" be done to ensure all the 10-year-olds in the audience don't get hopelessly confused."
rotten, A movie this adolescently dirty-minded could hardly pass up a chance to go to Lake Titicaca.
fresh, The creepy creativity does not fall far from the twisted tree in the filmmaking realm of writer-director Brandon Cronenberg...his impishly venomous vehicle percolates in the macabre mannerisms of his proud papa [David}...
rotten," The musical moments, on the whole, stand out as the highlights of the film; Rio 2 becomes watchable when the flat characters shut up and sing."
rotten," A comic-book flick through and through, with writing and a visual style that emulate the panels of graphic storytelling. This is both good and bad."
rotten," After Fantastic Beasts 2, J.K. Rowling should evaluate the road in which her wizarding world will go and analyze which voices will count. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten," Ocean's 8 is the all-female spin-off of the all-male Ocean's trilogy and it's a sop, with a third act that drags like nothing on earth."
rotten, Chaos -- and a bad script -- threaten the human race.
rotten," With this film you feel like it owe you something, that the idea could share or show more and the characters and their experiences deserve a better portrayal. But thats a lot to ask to Russel. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh," A bewildering introduction to the world of CB, particularly for an anime neophyte... but an enjoyable one nevertheless."
fresh," By the time ""Blue Jasmine"" arrives at one of Allen's most haunting finales, it has become a portrait of a delicate, troubled soul worthy of mention alongside Tennessee Williams."
fresh," An unnecessary remake perhaps, but a knowingly updated one, with strong work from Colin Farrell and David Tennant. This film is great fun."
rotten, All actors anxiously awaiting Oscar nominations in hopes of a career boost should go to Snow Dogs and gaze upon Cuba Gooding Jr.
fresh, Pure kindness and empathy at the heart of this biographical portrait.
rotten," This relegation of female characters to the sidelines is depressing for a film released in 2019, especially because it seems entirely possible to have a film looking at masculinity without reducing women to archetypes."
rotten, Forever After feels like a tired yank on the udders of a cash cow that's nearly dry.
fresh," In the realm of disco lights and thumping bass lines, mounting debt, hungover mornings and interchangeable sleeping partners, there's a real love story here about a man and his passion for his loops and beats."
rotten, A bad movie that could have been a lot better if it had been a little bit worse.
rotten," Offers attractive, inoffensive characters and a smattering of broad laughs, but it fails to use its potential to explore weightier themes such as John's mid-life crisis."
rotten," Based on the popular toy line, Trolls bears all the earmarks of a blatant cash-in on a recognizable property, with little imagination to speak of and predictable creative choices from beginning to end."
rotten, The Forger proves to be a completely counterfeit crime thriller.
rotten," Sandler and his writing partners jump from one crude gag to the next without a trace of a plot or narrative sense. This would be OK if any of the jokes were remotely funny, but they're mostly retreads of the bad jokes from the first movie."
rotten," Shrieking and ugly and tedious and soft-headed, not even giving the thin comfort of being hilariously bad."
rotten," a shallow, cliched biopic treatment from...Jalil Lespert. Niney is incredibly well matched physically to Saint Laurent but it is Gallienne who creates the more memorable character here"
fresh, Never says much about the marital institution that is fresh.
rotten," Some of the segments are more successful than others, but all of them could do with better actors."
rotten," It might help if screenwriters Trevor De Silva and Kevin Hood could hold to a consistent point of view, but it's never clear whether they and their director are playing these (largely fictionalised) proceedings straight or for satiric value."
rotten, There are laughs to be had in their cutting loose: Hahn's disdain and deadpan delivery are irresistible. But the film is too soppy and glossy to have us believe that motherhood is anything but a doddle.
rotten," It shorts its audience on the rich and vibrant experience it continually hints at, and for a horse that is rightly regarded as one of the greatest pure athletes who ever lived this is one race Secretariat doesn?t win."
rotten," You may jump and wince a couple of times, but only because the soundtrack features a few loud bangs that are cranked up beyond pain threshold."
rotten," Despite some strikingly flourishes, von Trier's latest makes him look less like a mad genius and more like he's simply, mad."
fresh," If you like that kind of banal, rustic and sophomoric humor (and I have to admit, I kinda do), it might be worth a buck or two at a discount theater."
rotten," With no narration or context, its subject matter comes across as dry, while the enviro-message is undermined by a yawn-inducing lack of urgency."
rotten, Think of The Book of Henry as a broken Rube Goldberg machine -- all the cutesy steampunk doo-dads are for naught without proper planning to make it function.
rotten," Much of the humor is cruel, not playful. (Lubricant replaced with glue? Try imagining that without clinching.)"
fresh," On the one hand, this is an inspirational movie about the power of journalism. On the other hand, it is a solemn reminder of the utter destruction that war can bring."
fresh, Mega Time Squad is an event that should be repeated.
rotten, This is one dumb sci-fi comedy that doesn't work in either genre.
fresh," [Inglorious Bastards] is pure cinema, pure theater, and entertaining"
rotten," The laughs are hit-or-miss, occasionally buoyed by Galifianakis' random absurdity or a surprising sight gag but otherwise unremarkable."
fresh," Like Drive, this is a film whose powerful visual style and hypnotic soundtrack help build the narrative up to a point which it might not otherwise have reached. "
rotten," From top to bottom, Fireworks is far too complicated, and frustratingly trite."
fresh, The result is completely intoxicating.
fresh," Filled with pomp and energy, RBG is a crowd-pleaser. "
fresh, Bertolucci never made another film that even came close to The Conformist
rotten," Chazelle and Singer have created a grueling, prosaic, state-of-the-art docudrama (no imagination allowed) with the heart of a male weepie."
fresh," This is an utterly human movie, the sort of character-driven project that's harder and harder to find these days."
rotten," Through interviews, court footage and backstage glimpses of rehearsals and performances, Bolshoi Babylon tells this story adequately, if unimaginatively."
rotten, Space Jam is so obviously a work of the marketing/demographic-hunting mentality that it's rather surprising to find that the brazen creature gathers a certain charm as it rolls along.
fresh, ...the end result is an effort that'll surely have a much more positive effect on fans than on neophytes to the Lizzie McGuire saga.
rotten," Its characters are unrecognizable to those of us inhabiting the real world, and despite its mounds and mounds of dialogue, it ultimately doesn't have a sticking thought in its pretty head."
fresh, Commandingly demonstrates that [Paul] Schrader is still worth listening to.
fresh, Staggeringly unsexy but strangely compelling.
rotten, Elwes in particular chews so much scenery I'm surprised any of the set was left for them to shoot the movie on.
fresh," Though somewhat slow out of the starting blocks, this finally caustic drama, set in early 1980s Bratislava (then in Czechoslovakia), accumulates power and insight as it builds over the course of a tense parents-teachers conference."
fresh," Develops some of that restlessness reminiscent of the tormented Blanche DuBois in Tennessee Williams' classic play, A Streetcar Named Desire."
rotten, Deep under the skin of this shrug of a movie is a solid metaphor rooted in an appealing fantasy.
rotten," Given all its volatile and exhilarating ingredients, it's disappointing that Race doesn't have greater impact."
fresh, A cunning spy thriller!
rotten," Sounds intriguing, but the actual movie is strangely plain, eyesore-overlit and uselessly frantic."
fresh," Self/less is enjoyable enough as a sleek and lightweight B movie, but it falls far short of the smart, searching futuristic morality tale it could have been."
rotten," The under-utilised 3D adds little to this prequel, which only serves as a sore reminder of the brilliance of the original films."
fresh, The result is that rarest of things -- a heartwarming love story that bears not a trace of cheap feeling or false emotion.
fresh," Blade Runner has only gotten better with time. Do yourself a favor and pass over anything new in theaters and go for this old classic, it still has the power to dazzle and amaze."
fresh," The magnificence of Weisz's performance is that she is never hiding anything, beyond what a 19th century woman might conceal out of polite reserve. In her every moment on screen, she is an open book. We're just not seeing all her pages."
rotten," It is a credit to this biopic that its leading man, Demetrius Shipp Jr, is an adequate double for the rapper and actor Tupac Shakur. Beyond that, there's little to be said for Benny Boom's film."
fresh, The connoisseur of filth within me is pleased to report how wonderfully nasty much of the felted proceedings here are to behold.
fresh, Boasts at least two artists at the top of their respective games -- namely filmmaker Peter Weir and actor Russell Crowe -- collaborating on a constantly compelling picture.
fresh," William Friedkin's adaptation of William Peter Blatty's novel, with a screenplay by the author, is a dead-serious meditation on the struggle between good and evil."
fresh, The chimp is adorable and the movie is just okay. It needed something to make it special and not just good.
rotten," The film is hysterical but inorganic, lacking blood, sweat, or tears."
fresh," Fragmented, insistent, erratic, the way this film unfolds eventually becomes an approximation of post-modern city life itself."
rotten, White Settles has little to offer. [Final review in Spanish]
rotten, The film's by-committee script is to blame for a cringe-worthy movie that could have worked much better had the younger characters been just a few years older.
fresh," But even with its flaws, The World's End serves up a wild plot, a boisterously engaging ensemble, and a sincere exploration of what friendship is. "
fresh, ... a heartfelt yet flawed look at the frailties of being human in a desperate time.
rotten," A slick heist tale with more twists than sense, this is one movie that ends up outsmarting itself."
fresh," This is X-Men and you shouldn't expect to be blown away by both the plot and action, but you can fully expect a plot that works much better than the reports are stating."
rotten," A guaranteed tear-jerker that serves as a decent reminder of America's very own Apartheid, it's fine as a slice of history. As a story though, it's sadly underwhelming."
fresh," Prometheus is atmospherically dazzling in a way that makes your eyeballs want to have a cigarette, zip up their pants and go out for breakfast afterwards."
rotten, This film is a fawning biopic that adds a thousand details to a portrait of Snowden that are only relevant if your goal is becoming president of the Edward Snowden fan club.
rotten," Garth Jennings's Sing effectively acknowledges early on that it's following a completely unoriginal formula, and yet carries on regardless."
fresh," It's a wonderful and spectacular film, shot from a child's point of view, though it is maybe too dark for children."
fresh," 30 Days of Night turns so monotonous and repetitive that, by the end, you feel as if you've lived through an entire month of Black Sundays."
rotten," Noomi Rapace tries her best to prop up this flatly generic, offputtingly chintzy action thriller."
rotten," ... we need to create memorable, endearing characters and stories that stay with one after the credits roll. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh," The moral of the story in Equalizer 2 is that if you don't find yourself on Robert McCall's bad side, you're likely to be okay."
rotten," Next Friday, after its midway mark, just lumbers until it fizzles out."
fresh, The original version of the oft-filmed science fiction horror is still the most insidious alien invasion film ever made.
fresh," A dig through [Clark] Terry's 2011 autobiography would be more instructive, but this still does the trick."
fresh, Nick Park's Early Man is as beguiling as previous Aardman Animation films
fresh, Rod Lurie has adapted with intelligence...
fresh," Premature, if nothing else, successfully treads similar waters as Love Jones and Mo Better Blues before it while keeping the story relevant to its own time."
rotten," It's proficiently put together but decidedly derivative, right down to the Usual Suspects-esque twist ending."
rotten," An ugly, hateful and deeply unfunny bit of hackwork that not only stinks on its own but also tarnishes the reputation of a genuinely funny and inspired comedy."
fresh, Your blood will curdle and boil.
rotten," If this was a tiny bit smarter (think Desperado, or even Kill Bill Vol. 1) or a whole lot dumber (Machete), it would be so much nearer to hitting its target."
rotten," It's not the idea, but the execution that is bothersome. It's totally predictable."
fresh," The movie never feels long, partly because of Azabal's terrific performance."
fresh," Wes Anderson's seventh feature is a delight from start to finish, thanks to a wonderful script, a typically fabulous soundtrack, achingly stylish direction, gorgeous production design work and terrific performances from a superb cast."
fresh," A well-acted and surprisingly affecting thriller, all things considered, and a satisfying mystery, if not a shocking one."
fresh," This might not be an entirely accurate history lesson, but it's certainly an entertaining one. "
rotten," There are a couple of intriguing ideas floating around here and there, but that's all they do -- float around, unmoored by any sense of reality and, thus, suspense."
rotten," As is often the case, a lot of the freshness so abundant in the original is all but gone now from Hotel Transylvania 3: A Monster Vacation."
rotten," With its beautiful images and its overwhelming gravitas, it feels like a movie with a message. Unfortunately, on the way to delivering that message, it becomes weighted down by its own dreary self-importance. "
fresh, A pleasant diversion that vanishes from your mind right after you watch it.
fresh," When all of the movie's elements are working together -- the familiar characters and story, and the eye-catching special effects -- it's a wonderfully entertaining ride."
fresh, Teen Titans GO! to the Movies might be aimed at fans of the manic and underrated Cartoon Network show but any parent who tags along will likely chortle as the film gleefully skewers the world of superheroes and the film industry itself.
fresh, Reynolds takes suffering for your art to unimaginable new depths in this truly underground chiller. As he excels at reaching into the theater and grabbing viewer minds. Which gives a radically new meaning to the notion of being embedded in a war zone.
rotten," The latest James Bond flick falls as flat as Tomorrow Never Dies, with decent action sequences and bad soap opera acting."
rotten," The spirit of inconsequential whimsy prevails throughout, with recurrent shots of traffic and the New York skyline helping blend different sensibilities into a multinational soup."
rotten, The blooper outtakes over the end credits are funnier than the entire movie.The standout cameo belongs to J.B. Smoove playing a... 
rotten," With no real sense of danger or urgency, the ""adventure"" of the Dawn Treader remains as by-the-books and generic as ever."
fresh," My resistance to summer blockbusters crumbled like a collapsing skyscraper in the face of this big, loud, exuberantly destructive movie."
fresh," Blades of Glory is directed by the two guys who make the Geico caveman commercials. They haven't made a first-rate Ferrell comedy, but they do understand the kind of absurdism and physical comedy prized by his fans."
fresh," The joy in watching ""American Made"" is considerably driven by Cruise's wide-eyed astonishment with every twist and turn happening to Seal. This is a role that was tailor-made for the 55-year-old-actor."
rotten," A succession of misadventures and misunderstandings, without which there would be no plot, land Sawyer in a psychiatric hospital, which is just as clearly the worst possible place for someone who keeps insisting on her sanity."
fresh, We Are the Best! seems like [Moodysson's] clearest vision to date.
rotten, The movie seems content to operate without a soul.
rotten," In THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE, relatively standard mad scientist horror film elements combine with a truly twisted premise."
rotten," Maybe we shouldn't have expected too much from ""The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water."""
rotten," As straight-laced as its Victorian-era setting, the film lacks gusto."
rotten," From start to finish, the movie basks in horrible horror clichés that will leave viewers straining to find something original in the proceedings."
rotten," Moore is as engaging as ever but the film's message is nonsense. It is more likely that France will become more like the USA than the other way around. That is how capitalism works, after all."
rotten," The same bland, lazy filmmaking Allen's been doing for years, only without the humor and with different accents."
rotten," When Pixels isn't focusing on its battles with Pac-Man, Donkey Kong and Centipede, it feels like a lot of other bad Sandler movies."
fresh, Mr. Right is aiming to be a tent-pole film that just happens to have a lot of dead bodies and just as many dutiful shots of the New Orleans skyline. The gambit may just work.
fresh, The right kind of trouble.
rotten," Most fans of costume drama don't head to the movies expecting explosive exit wounds, and few action fans are going to be wowed by ostentatious lapels."
fresh," A science-fiction masterpiece that's largely about our perceptions of time and our struggles to communicate...unexpectedly romantic and profound in its deeper concerns, by exploring the happy-sad nature of existence itself, of being born to die."
rotten," A high action, shoot 'em up flick that bombards your senses as well as your common sense."
rotten," The scenes focused on lukewarm dialogue outnumber the action scenes ten to one, giving the film a listless, low-energy vibe."
rotten," Instead of giving you the book, it leaves you with the unfulfilled sense of having leafed through an elegant, studiously captioned photo essay of the same material."
rotten," Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween does have a fair amount of bite for a PG-rated horror film, but the plot mechanics never quite come together, and it is also fairly predictable."
rotten, Derailed is a choo-choo bound for oblivion - - and making no stops for plausibility along the way.
fresh, Diary of a Country Priest in New York State. A fine Ethan Hawke and Amanda Seyfried. Ending is a bit off the rails.
rotten," With a little more anti-authoritarian spirit, The Perfect Score might have been a rousing call to arms for a whole generation."
rotten," The drama never feels more than a well-shot TV soap. Worse is Roos' tragic insistence on text inserts to explain every motivation, making the whole thing look like a fatal cross between Queer As Folk and VH1's Pop Up Video."
rotten," If nothing else, Watchmen is a commendable feat of art direction. As far as finding a narrative rhythm, however, the film could have stood a little rescuing itself."
fresh," Hey boyfriend/director has delivered Greta Gerwig a role tailor made for her, a vivid portrait of a New York ""type"" in the age of social media. "
fresh," Not Lubitsch at the top of his form, but good."
fresh," A complex portrait about a complex area of the country, where things are not as simple as everyone has been led to believe."
fresh," Good kitty! Superior in every way to its underwhelming predecessor, Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties is a genuinely clever kidpic that should delight moppets, please parents -- and maybe tickle a few tweens."
rotten," The greatest stars in the world could not salvage something so ill-conceived, however, and neither can director Andy Tennant."
rotten," Hay en esta versión cinematográfica del video juego cierto espíritu clásico que invita a recuperar algo de aquella inocencia y que hace recordar, por momentos, a aventuras como las de Indiana Jones. Solo que El Príncipe de Persia difícilmente se convierta"
rotten," With a powerhouse cast and an anaemic script, this violent revenge thriller never quite gets off the ground."
rotten," Like the stroke of midnight, ""New Year's Eve"" disappears almost instantly, leaving little behind but limp streamers and the sense that, surely, there was a better party going on somewhere else."
fresh, Steady but slightly lacking.
rotten," The Nut Job 2 goes full throttle on the timely stuff, resulting in a (slightly) more thoughtful and entertaining outing."
fresh," If you're a fan of old-style Hong Kong martial arts movies, you should find Ong-Bak a blast. And even if not, you may be surprised at how much dumb fun it is."
rotten, There's something fundamentally disappointing about watching Raimi use his considerable resources to just make more wonderful scat.
rotten," The advantage of adapting Maurice Sendak's slim tome is that there is plenty of scope for interpretation; however, for the first time in his career, Jonze comes up short in the imagination department."
rotten," If this shrill, manipulative, sledge-hammer allegory is right for our times, give me Dante any day. Von Trier has certainly done better, but never worse. "
fresh," This 'toon doesn't lack heart amid all the high-flying antics, but it may have benefited from a heartier dose of imagination."
fresh," Watching ""Precious,"" you have to wonder--does it offer this year's inconvenient truth?"
rotten," Let's pick at the title of the programme...That ""almost"". What's it doing there? We're still paying for the banking crisis, financially and politically, so ""almost"" seems a bit tentative. A broken thing can be fixed--but that doesn't mean it didn't break."
rotten," Paying homage to his previous and better work, Reitman's new comedy is marked by one-idea story, sporadic humor that lacks wit, and cheesy special effects."
fresh," Visually stunning, capably presented, and utterly unnecessary, this final in the six-movie Tolkien cycle is just for the fans. "
fresh," Offbeat soundtrack selections and effective music by composer Andrew Harris help set the mood - ultimately genial and hopeful, and the movie is short and sweet."
fresh, Acrophobics beware: just watching Philippe Petit walk across Twin Towers will make you dizzy.
rotten, Interesting idea about empathy turns into disturbing fable.
fresh, A cheerfully cynical romantic comedy in which the romantic lead is also the villain -- and still somehow finds her way to a happy ending.
rotten," Unfunny ""comedy"" is crude, profane, drug-filled."
fresh," This isn't easy to watch. But it's compelling, disturbing, and, sadly, true to life."
fresh," For a film that's 95 percent talk, Lions for Lambs is admirably fast-paced, energized with something often missing in movies: ideas."
fresh, Knightley is up to the task. Her Georgiana is history with a human face.
fresh," What is most intriguing in the film are the words, indeed the presence, of Barnes himself."
fresh, The chilling beauty of the production is let down a little by a confused and increasingly senseless plot.
fresh," As art, Drive is extraordinary. As a film for general audiences, it's bound to be misunderstood, condemned as pornographic, or exploited for cheap thrills."
fresh, Bruno Dumont's employment of his bucolic French backdrop here attends to Hors Satan's muddying spiritual ambiguity.
fresh, A complicated cowboy flick where you're conflicted about whether to root for the guys in the white hats or the black hats by the time the big showdown arrives.
fresh," A quiet, contemplative noir thriller with a look and tone uncannily reminiscent of Hitchcock and a slow, brooding pace that at times undermines its effectiveness."
fresh," Jarmusch brings his arthouse sensibilities to the vampire genre, removing the focus from needless stereotypes and finding the humanity in the inhuman."
rotten," No matter how much lame macho talk there is about appreciating life after you've faced death, it's difficult to be moved by a guy who's facing danger that would be entirely preventable if he would just stop paddling right into it."
fresh," It is [Robert] Pattinson who shines. Once a vampire hunk, he has grown into the kind of actor the camera loves - even if preteen girls no longer will."
rotten, There are some good ideas here but they're buried under masses of conventional superhero dross and half hearted execution. This is one vigilante who should really just leave all the hard work to the police.
rotten," Although Diesel's flexathon is certainly the wrong message in the wrong time, the only harm it can do is through the aggregate culmination of like-minded films."
fresh, Well-restrained and rarely melodramatic
fresh, Surprisingly funny and smartly acted.
fresh, This is summer action done right.
rotten," It's his silliest film since 1990's The Rookie, only without the guilty pleasures of, say, watching Charlie Sheen burn down a bar using nothing more than his natural fire-breathing talents."
rotten," Spurlock, who revolutionized activist documentary filmmaking with Super Size Me, has set the genre back with this cinema equivalent of a glossy teen magazine cover."
rotten," An amped-up love-conquers-all fantasy, one replete with a dash to a church, a last minute declaration of love, and a cop-out conclusion that renders the preceding action pretty much irrelevant."
fresh," This isn't your daddy's James Bond. Gone is the shaken, not-stirred, martini-swilling, smart-assed letch that beds babes by the bunch."
fresh," The vision of the world expressed here is warm and lovely, full of irrepressible positivity. While all negativity is excluded from Wardrop's vision, life's darkness hovers outside the artfully constructed frame."
rotten," The latest fashioning of the almost 160-year-old narrative is lighthearted, as befitting its comic take on the tragic story, but also light on depth."
rotten," The Wannabe is too derivative for any insight, offering little more than tired tropes and bad accents."
rotten, A retread of just about every home-invasion movie of the past 50 years mixed with elements of torture porn and chick-flick romance.
rotten, Director Garry Marshall's ensemble romantic-comedy Valentine's Day is ultimately too superficial and slick to really touch the heart.
fresh," The by-play between the stars is riveting, with Deneuve boldly playing against type as a gluttonous, gambling harridan. Moreover, it's good to see a film exploring midlife ennui from a female perspective for a change."
rotten," A trashy, pandering camp homage to the cute quirks of homosexuality."
fresh," By the end, you actually want these two cardboard cutouts to get together."
fresh, It's undeniably effective and pretty engrossing. And there's something to be said for the unconventional way it sucks viewers in.
fresh, The immaculate Beyoncé Knowles and devastatingly handsome Idris Elba attack their silly parts with a ferocity the gives this dumpy little movie the spark it needs to be compelling.
fresh," The film looks great and Blunt gives a wonderfully confident performance, but the end result lacks real insights into what made Victoria the great and enduring queen she became."
rotten," What's on screen is stilted and dull, not helped by willowy blonde Helene Bergsholm in the lead, more suited to modeling than acting."
fresh," ""The Drop"" could have been an ordinary crime drama, but it's elevated by extraordinary performances."
rotten," It's a thoroughly unpleasant experience that, at best, is somewhat humorous as a sketch. At worst, it's an endless trudge through the mind of toxic, irresponsible man-children."
rotten," ""Jobs"" gets tripped up by the same old biopic problems: it's too much of a greatest-hits overview, not enough of an incisive dive into its subject."
rotten, Rosi completely fails to connect the two sides of the story together.
fresh," If Douglas Sirk had directed a film noir written by Billy Wilder, it might have looked something like the latest thoughtful tangle of philosophy and whimsy from the Coen Brothers. "
fresh, Gleefully demonstrates that a barely convincing narrative and nearly two hours of sci-fi spectacle can still entertain.
rotten," While film fans might enjoy DePalma's stylistic homages to Hitchcock, and John Lithgow's total commitment to concept and character, there is little else to recommend about Raising Cain. "
fresh, Has the anarchistic and madcap charm of an old Chuck Jones Warner Brothers movie.
fresh," Simón's touching, tender autobiography falls in between the greats like THE 400 BLOWS and PONETTE, yet is completely unique and deeply personal."
fresh, The film would be nasty if it weren't clever (and sometimes horribly funny).
fresh, A true work of art from [director] Sam Mendes...
rotten," Purees your brain for two hours...proudly and pointedly credited as 'A Frank Coraci Movie'-not a film, y'hear? Nerd-os, go home!"
fresh," [Jolie]'s oozing that mysterious charisma that's half dazzling intelligence and half riveting talent and half the magic of the gods of Hollywood smiling on her, and through her."
rotten, An old-fashioned weepie buffed to a Masterpiece Theater gloss.
rotten," When the action is at its sharpest, such as with Henry's mid-chase leap from a detonating truck onto the back of a motorcycle, it's spectacular. Other times, it can be as wearying as generically hyper-edited Hollywood fare."
fresh," A simmering stew, albeit one that never quite boils over"
fresh, You'll leave the theater a better person.
fresh, It is Foster and Howard's performances that really help this movie rise above just a revenge fantasy.
fresh, Narratively bereft...thematically redundant...[but] fans of the series and fanboy grumblers may have to agree that The Battle of the Five Armies is often entertaining.
rotten," Bug straddles the lines of genre seediness and high art pretension, but it's not enough of a cheap thrill or mindbender to succeed at either."
fresh, The Guilty is an entertaining and inventive thriller that contains a few interesting twists and some top-notch performances and sound design.
fresh," Get Out is a great movie for people who dislike or dismiss horror expecting ""gratuitous"" explicit violence and nudity, because of its humor, PG sex scenes, and the analogies drawn to contemporary lived experiences of race relations. "
rotten," To call God's Not Dead 2 ""bad"" would be doing this abomination of a movie a disservice. It is not only a bad movie, but in fact it's more than that."
fresh," Unlike his earlier works, though, [John Cameron Mitchell] turns the writing task over to the play's author, Lindsay-Abaire, making Rabbit Hole a hired gun kind of film."
fresh," The joy of seeing Martin Lawrence again onstage, telling jokes, supersedes for his fans the content of his message."
rotten," Hamlet 2 is a likable movie even as it careens around like a wagging tail, but it's just too uneven."
rotten," The over-the-top performances would usually be suitable for this style of musical romp but the story, songs and dance numbers are not strong enough to sustain such hammy performances."
fresh, La Camioneta succeeds by telling the bus's story while also expanding upon the different people who have now become a part of the bus's orbit.
fresh," 'Norman' is a reminder of Gere's specific gifts as an actor, and how they've been taken for granted far too long."
fresh," Damien Chazelle, by looking unromantically at how NASA's Apollo program hurled astronauts onto the face of the moon, has made the most inspiring big-studio film in years. Maybe decades."
fresh," While not as comprehensive or objective as one would hope, this vivid documentary will prove fascinating to history buffs."
fresh, ...wily and engaging...
rotten," ...nobody -- not the audience, and certainly not the cast -- deserves a clunker like this."
rotten," Partly a cautionary tale about the dangers of decades of bodybuilding and partly a throwback to the good old days of the Reagan era, when all you needed to make an action film was a man with muscles, an exotic setting and a hundred screaming extras ..."
rotten, As cold as it is dumb.
fresh, Life is hard. Cancer is hard. Relationships are hard. Family is hard. '50/50' managed to find the power in all of those things and give us plenty of laughs so we're not simply in a ball crying.
fresh," The rare crime movie with room for both commentary on the housing crisis and ""That's what she said"" jokes."
rotten, At least they gave Freddy a back story - that's a good thing. That it made no sense - that's a bad thing.
fresh," A stunning, humane, but difficult film about the human aftermath of the Hiroshima bombing."
rotten," Zatoichi finds a legacy diminished by his new, updated masters. "
fresh, Another triumph for Pixar - a 3-D animated feature about a memorable cross-generation friendship that is also a probe on the true meaning of adventure
rotten," Two dull people have a dull love affair in ""Summertime,"" a French drama that drags on like an August afternoon."
fresh," The real triumph is that while we are fascinated with the particulars of the story, we feel the shame, awkwardness, fears and cosmic fate that bounce off each character."
fresh, Bernal and Luna have great sibling comic chemistry.
fresh," What we get is a cultural standoff, and it's awkward, nonsensical and really funny."
rotten," There's a difference between showmanship and showing off, and Kattan has not yet learned that."
rotten," I counted three laughs in this wannabe bawdy comedy of errors, and one of them was a Breaking Bad gag so far past its tell-by date that even I got the joke."
fresh," Minions, their very own spin-off film, takes [the] undifferentiated mass of fun and nonsense and successfully channels it into a pleasing movie shape."
rotten, Tries but fails to be an action-hero flick or even a parody of one.
fresh," Take a look again at its dream sequences, especially the nocturnal one involving the young man in the side street, and you will see a master disturber still at work."
rotten, Where to start with all the things wrong with this film?
fresh," Hidden Figures"" is crowd-pleasing entertainment of vital history."
rotten, House of Wax is practically a textbook case on how not to make [a horror] film. 
rotten," Inches toward melodrama and dramatic overcrowding, weakening a previously intimate study of curiosity."
rotten," There are a few legitimate scares in the film, but they don't stick with you like those in the first Insidious."
rotten," Since director Iain Softley seems more interested in establishing tone and atmosphere than in creating vital personalities, he is unable to harness the full power of his story."
fresh, Do not miss this one.
rotten," The acting might be shoddy, the plot nonsense and the dialogue clunky, but the fighting is exquisitely done. Inventive, athletic, fun, stylish and tight, it's everything the rest of the film isn't."
rotten," Each CGI set piece erases distance, space, weight, gravity and wit. It's empty, soulless action -- visual noise."
fresh," The film puts its viewers through a wringer and through a journey, right up to its final glimpse of a soldier, though long returned, finally beginning to come home."
fresh," Coming from Cronenberg, the question arises: Is that all there is?"
fresh," Like a second hand clothes shop, it is comfortable rather than exciting, predictable rather than refreshing, even though it boasts a great cast who believe in their master, Woody Allen"
fresh," By equating the garish feudalism of the play's original setting with the megalopolis of today's New York, [Almereyda is] at least on the right track. The problem is, it's just about his only track."
fresh," It's the Farrellys picking up where they left off with 2000's Me, Myself & Irene, dishing out a line-up of audience-goosing bits; spiky material that returns a little of the water-cooler visibility they used to enjoy (two words: donkey show)"
fresh," Lord know we don't need another biopic of a troubled but brilliant musician, but writer/director Robert Budreau dives into the psychology of a figure like Baker with a depth that such films rarely muster."
rotten," This is just the sort of metaphor-heavy story that can so easily slide into soppy sentimentality, and director Irwin Winkler does nothing to stop it."
fresh," May not be without faults, including some unlikely action montages and occasional overacting, but boredom is not one of them. This thing is about as dull as street luge."
fresh," Give these two a better script, and you just might have a comedy classic. Instead, we have here a tolerable near-miss; enough to keep the hunger pangs away until a real meal arrives."
fresh, An enthralling and deliciously entertaining movie -- and a deserved triumph for its star and director.
fresh," With ""A Scanner Darkly,"" Richard Linklater proves that anything worth doing is worth doing right, no matter how painstaking a process doing it right might prove to be."
fresh, As simple and innocent a movie as you can imagine. This is a movie you can trust.
rotten, The film never finds the right rhythm to present the passion of the young couple onscreen. [Full Review in Spanish]
fresh," A perceptive, powerfully acted psychodrama."
rotten, ...most of the way it feels like a padded TV skit.
rotten," The get-the-President movie, a genre we might term ""POTUS in Peril"", has had a chequered history... but [London Has Fallen] adds almost nothing in the way of innovation or inspiration."
fresh, A gripping and superbly directed picture with something to say about the nature of infatuation and obsession.
fresh, Its genre elements are completely honed down to their basest elements and exploited for the most fun possible.
fresh, A high concept window in on the direction George Lucas could have gone.
fresh," Creed is less a continuation of the Rocky story and more of a new beginning within the same universe; similar in narrative and theme, but built for a new generation."
rotten, There's nothing really about it that's its own.
rotten, The director takes a fascinating true story of recovery through creative expression and drags it across a sticky-saccharine stretch of the uncanny valley.
rotten, Das' warm direction conveys a palpable affection for these people. But the thin plot keeps the audience at a distance. 
fresh, A terrific big-screen version that should satisfy Peanuts fans and generate new ones.
fresh," Although [this film] is easily the best entry in the (theoretically) Bilbo-centric franchise, the inherent problems with blowing up a compact children's fantasy book into a three-part epic film series... is never more apparent than it is here."
rotten," So embarrassing that, for the first time, I wanted to avert my eyes from the screen, although that might have also been because Repo! appears to have been shot with a cell phone."
rotten," A big broad arrow aiming at the bullseye of the mainstream, Unfinished Song hits its target, but whether that relatively low bar deserves to celebrated is up for debate."
rotten," Has a few genuinely funny moments, but on the whole it's repetitive and stale."
rotten," The movie ignores the rule of three, instead repeating its best jokes just enough for them to funny the second time around. Unfortunately, MacGruber's best jokes are few and far between."
rotten, The main problem is that they spelled the title wrong. The first vowel should be an I.
fresh, Surpasses the extraordinary visual standards set by its predecessors.
rotten," Despite a talented cast and some incredibly rich source material, Alice Through the Looking Glass is little more than an ill-conceived and empty bauble, a candy-coated turd attempting (and failing) to pass as a delicious treat. "
fresh," Although released in a climate oversaturated with apocalyptic visions and walking dead, [Marc] Forster's film carves a niche as a smart and thoughtfully stylized adaptation ..."
rotten," Not just a pitiful example of 'churn 'em out' genre cinema, but is also perhaps set to be the most chauvinistic, sexist movie of the year."
rotten, Sixty seconds is all a professional car thief needs to steal a car. It takes about the same time for a moviegoer to know he or she is watching a Jerry Bruckheimer movie.
fresh, Anyone seeking proof that a movie can transcend its subject should look to Silver Linings Playbook.
rotten," The love story is pure mush, not helped by the bland voice work done by Kevin Bacon as Balto and Bridget Fonda as dainty husky Jenna."
rotten," 'Grey' deserved a concentrated attack. It gets a scattershot one, though one that's ultimately, mostly, on the side of the angels"
fresh, The most engrossing and flat-out entertaining documentary to come around since Murderball...
rotten," You friendly neighbourhood web-slinger returns for more of the same, albeit with added confusion and much less charm."
rotten, This uninspired version amounts to lukewarm sloppy seconds in comparison to the original film that made director John Carpenter a hot property.
fresh," It stokes memories of an era of clever, adventurous and genuinely sweet movies for kids, on one hand, while planting a future memory of quality for today's tykes."
rotten," Frosty, gritty and utterly predictable. "
fresh," While its most dazzling scenes recall David Cronenberg's The Fly and Schrader's Catpeople, it topples into self-parody in spells, as if John Waters was remaking In The Realm Of The Senses."
fresh," We should have our own movies like ""The Innocents."" But it's good that we can at least import them."
fresh, What Stories We Tell does so brilliantly is both tell the story and tell about how we tell our stories. The truth may not be out there.
fresh, The founder is a very entertaining biopic that has chosen the path of conventionality and lack of risk to tell a story that is way above the film itself. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh," Despite its flaws and grim veneer, Tanović's drama makes for compelling and touching cinema with something crucial to say."
fresh," I have never encountered anything quite so auditorily menacing... I promise you have never seen, or heard, anything like it, and Toby Jones's performance is fantastically gripping."
rotten, In the Loop is a confusingly plotted satire -- plan on being out of the loop -- that starts off at such a frantic pace and at so high a pitch that it really doesn't have anywhere to go.
fresh," The Kids Are All Right is warmly recommended to anyone in search of smart, grown-up entertainment."
fresh, A realistic and moving account of a major 20th century atrocity.
fresh," Without ever touching on a cliche (except to poke fun at it), Shyamalan skillfully builds the film on several layers -- personal redemption, family drama, community-in-crisis, world on the brink."
fresh," [It's] light, larky stuff. But the underlying message of empowerment and equality is nothing to sneeze at."
rotten, So extensive is Unknown's pilfering of ideas from existing films that it has left itself exposed as a meagre mishmash that fails to excel in any particular department.
rotten," The film captures the energy, the stresses and the tension of people striking punching bags and each other but without narration, it all feels a bit random and uninteresting."
fresh," I think that, if someone really wanted to adopt (as my dear parents did), it would take more than a single movie to dissuade them."
rotten, Vanderbilt's - based on a self-serving memoir by Mapes - wilfully twists the truth to defend the piece that led to Rather and Mapes' joint fall from grace and greatly damaged the reputation of American journalists with the public.
rotten," Situational comedies need some believability to be effective, and too many gags in Klown feel like punchlines whose set-ups were engineered in reverse..."
rotten," It's all shot and edited in a cut-to-ribbons, unsatisfying, no-stakes CGI way."
fresh," It's a movie about making choices in tough circumstances, and for the most part Hill makes pretty good ones."
fresh," A showcase of Taraji P. Henson's vast comedic talent, What Men Want effectively turns the tables on the male-centered ""why can't we get along"" narrative, into an entertaining and refreshing perspective on the question"
fresh," Sy is terrific in this. As Samba, he just seems like a really good guy - honest, hardworking, ethical and also emotionally strong. He's someone you would want in your country."
fresh," This bid by the National Lampoon team to cash in with some Naked Gun-style spoofery lacks the brainless invention of the latter films, but still manages to score quite a few laughs."
fresh," Just when it looked like the vampire genre had been bled dry, along comes the insanely inspired horror-satire ""What We Do in the Shadows"" to give it fresh bite."
fresh," Most sobering in Davis' film is the assembled confab of prep tutors sharing their unvarnished thoughts about the College Board's pointless, periodical test fixes, practically cackling at how easily the board's self-importance has kept them in business."
fresh, The 3-D technology enables Napier to establish audience rapport with the principals who literally emerge from the stage. It is a remarkably intimate experience.
rotten," What should have been, could have been. It sure isn't this Green Slacker."
fresh," [A] stunningly confident, category-defying, broken-down dream piece about loss and being lost...irresistible."
fresh," The pantheon gets its overdue spotlight in Morgan Neville's ""Twenty Feet From Stardom,"" a documentary nearly as glorious as the voices it celebrates."
rotten," Try not to hoot when the gaunt Roberts makes a bring-on-the-flab speech to persuade the equally slender Tuva Novotny to eat pizza, even if they get ""muffin tops."""
rotten," It's pretty much all chase flick and very little exposition. The problem is the film becomes SO far-fetched, you can't possibly turn your brain off and buy into its dizzying pace and twisting, turning storyline. (Parental Review also Available)"
rotten," The movie feels both too soon and too late; an often skillful assemblage of bits and pieces, telling a story we already know and, ultimately, letting it fade away without an ending."
fresh, The end result is so compelling that it leaves you wanting to see Thurgood take on his next case. Is a TV series based on Marshall's career too much to ask for?
fresh," Oliver Stone stirs up a new emotion: Nostalgia. Oh, the halcyon days of 2003!"
fresh," Berg's film offers something of a corrective portrayal of corporate greed trumping regard for human life, with a massive Hollywood set functioning as his soda can."
rotten," Aardman is a haven for creatures that hail from other species but match us or even outstrip us in proficiency and grace. Early Man, though, is stuffed with men and women...whereas the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air are reduced to extras."
rotten," ""Every Day"" [is] more ambitious than your average teen romance, which only makes it all the more disappointing that it simply remains an average teen romance."
fresh," A huge and satisfying meal of a movie. Like, six courses worth."
fresh," Sorkin's dialogue in Moneyball is as brilliantly acerbic as it is in Network. Luckily so, because for a baseball movie, there isn't much baseball."
rotten, A manipulative script about dog reincarnation that whacks your emotions like a piñata - that's forgivable. But no mercy for a film charged with canine abuse behind the scenes. It shouldn't happen to a dog. 
fresh, A rattling scare show with a brain. Defies expectations by shattering conventions of the classic horror-anthology style.
rotten, Serve as a slap in the face.
rotten," Surrounded by cannibalistic gore, Ethan Hawke and Willem Dafoe line up to drink some valuable box-office blood...call it 'From Here to Vampurity'."
fresh, It's a gorgeous abstraction-- an epically sustained 129-minute sigh of heartache and regret.
rotten," Great concept, stale on dialogue; strong climax."
rotten, Miami Vice is about as hip as a marathon session of Uno.
rotten, It makes an occasionally spirited pretense of injecting the tensions of the United States's educational system into a familiar zombie-siege scenario.
fresh," A well-made entry in the fashionable caper-movie genre, which has gathered steam lately with Ocean's Eleven and others."
rotten," First, you try to understand what the hell is going on. Then you slowly realize that you will never understand what is going on. And, last, you wind up with the distinct impression that, if there was anything to understand, it wasn't worth the sweat."
rotten," Seems to want nothing more than for the audience to pat itself on the back because they know what Yavin 4 is: It's a fun game to play at Comic-Con, but it doesn't make for much of a movie."
fresh," Most of it makes no sense at all, but who cares? This is cheerful ridiculousness pulled off with panache."
fresh," Coogler knows fully too well the reach of something like Black Panther, and he uses the Marvel canvas to paint a bigger - but more importantly, a powerful - picture."
rotten, A film whose level of imagination can be discerned right from its title.
rotten, An After School Special done up in gritty indie style.
rotten," Fans of John Carpenter will likely receive a brief contact high from recognizable cinematic construction, but the overall effort is more disappointing than distressing."
fresh," One of the best-looking, best-acted spy movies we've seen in a long while."
fresh, Good Time works as an overwhelming stylistic game that starts from a miserable vision of New York to go progressively towards a kind of great guignol. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh, Cartel Land is a brilliantly exposed snapshot of a hugely complicated situation.
rotten," This biopic of property magnate and pornographer Paul Raymond is mildly entertaining at times and does raise a few cheap chuckles, but it's as shallow as a Soho puddle after a spring shower."
fresh," Rapaport, in his feature directorial debut, does an admirable job recounting the group's formation and dissecting its dissolution."
rotten, By the end of the film you get the feeling that Depp himself is wondering just how much longer he can fake the funk for a paycheck.
rotten," Aside from a few flourishes of aesthetic inventiveness and a single moment of genuine wonder, ""Ant-Man and The Wasp"" doesn't do very much with its premise."
rotten, Like a student film by someone who's never seen a movie by anyone other than Terrence Malick.
fresh," ""Wilson"" has much of the same everything-sucks humor that gave Clowes' ""Ghost World"" such sardonic punch 15 years ago, and Harrelson has a ball delivering insults with that goofy grin on his face."
fresh, Thanks to McConaughey's oily power and Friedkin's unflinching purpose it's a compelling beast.
fresh, Todd Haynes has crafted a feature-length homage to Sirk that succeeds both on its own terms and as the Sirk film that could never have been made in his own lifetime.
rotten," A neat concept, but dull as all hell."
fresh, The movie plods along rather deliberately until the climactic confrontation at the end ---- then the action becomes riveting.
rotten, Meant for a kiddie audience. Adults will be brain dead by the time they sit through all the squeaky songs
rotten," Jason Bateman accidentally swallows a mouthful of projectile baby poop... To quote Watchmen, 'If you begin to feel an intense and crushing feeling of terror at the concept, don't be alarmed. That indicates only that you are still sane.'"
fresh," Toes in one side of the brain and out the other, leaving little trace."
rotten," The film flirts with big ideas about adult relationships, but fails to locate any gravitas about its characters' existential or psychological crises."
rotten," At the end, I felt suspended between ""so beautiful"" and ""so what."" (Sorry for lifting your phrase, Paul Simon.)"
fresh," Skull Island, for a lot of reasons, shouldn't work-until, suddenly, it does. (Splice Today) "
fresh, The sublime and the insane make engaging traveling companions in Embrace Of The Serpent.
fresh," The Visitor gives viewers a perceptive, deeply personal take on the timeless immigrant narrative, in which the most epic journey is finally one of self-discovery."
fresh, A welcome return to form for Dayton and Faris
fresh, Curiously sticky with the residue of lurid exploitation.
rotten," Uneven, fluctuating between poignancy...and fluff."
fresh, You don't have to strain to detect a political edge to the story.
rotten, The most bloodless and least involving film about turn-of-the-century society since Merchant-Ivory's The Bostonians.
rotten, For an hour or so it's a reasonably entertaining B movie. I just wish it had sustained that entertainment all the way to the end.
rotten," Manages to deliver a decent film with some strong scares, yet certain moments will feel like a haunted trip you've already taken one too many times before."
rotten," Screenwriter Jon Vitti and first-time directors Fergal Reilly and Clay Kaytis certainly give it a try, but their bag of tricks is mostly recycled and their sense of humor is aimed squarely at 12-year-old boys."
fresh," In what has shaped up to be a great year for horror, Cam stands near the top of the year's best."
rotten, Presumptuous cultural tourism of the worst kind makes up Jay Dockendorf's unbelievable and offensive contemplation of young black lives.
rotten, The Monuments Men is one of those films that disappoints despite the best intentions and efforts.
fresh," Watching the late Philip Seymour Hoffman as a drained, despairing spymaster in A Most Wanted Man, it's hard not to find the shadow of his tragically early death hanging over his character."
fresh, Think 'The Da Vinci Code.' except with less talk and way more action. 
rotten," If Mom was still alive, she would be as mad as a wet hen. Or maybe a dry penguin."
fresh," Intensive Care is worth watching for its charismatic lead, Tara Macken, who has good stunt and martial arts skills. But overall, the final product languishes in mediocrity. See it because you're a fan of the low-budget action movie genre."
fresh," It's a warm, affecting tribute, taking us inside the blessed existence of the person John Waters calls the world's greatest outsider."
rotten," As good as the movie is performance-wise, [director Sally] Potter allows the pacing to drag frequently, meaning viewers must be patient with Ginger & Rosa."
fresh," The film has a real voice, and it's apparent that West is getting more and more comfortable as a filmmaker."
rotten, It doesn't know whether it wants to be dark and moodily glamorous or ridiculous and gory -- it's a creature feature suffering from extreme class consciousness.
rotten," Not that it's a bad film, it just needed to be cooked a little more."
rotten," Unless you're a 15-year-old boy who thinks motorcycle racing on dirt tracks is the 'next big thing,' you may ignore the release of Supercross."
fresh," It's a small, almost delicate film that will richly reward those who connect with it."
rotten, As conventional as Fight Club was provocative.
fresh," What can you say about a movie that has not one, not two, but three scenes of improvised oral surgery?"
rotten," After 2016's Monster Trucks laid a giant goose egg at the box office, what made the folks at Global Road think this similarly themed shaggy mechanical pal tale would fare any better?"
rotten," Sending a woman around the world to find her anchor may be a nice concept to begin with, but the script of... Fidelio - Alice's Journey lacks the necessary structure to sustain it all through or lead it securely into safe harbour."
fresh," From start to finish, Amelie is a captivating charmer."
rotten," This stagnating set-up for a finale wallows in self-seriousness. There's so much glumness and lethargy here, a new character--call him Excelsior Lugubrious--emerges from the mega-budget, moody mist, threatening to slay Death himself with Sleep."
rotten," Save for the music, there's nothing authentic about it."
rotten, [The] story could have benefitted from being a bit more restrained.
rotten," As a barely extended stand-up special that seems better fit as an HBO or Pay-Per-View event, Kevin Hart: What Now? isn't worth the prices most theaters charge for admission."
rotten, The tragedy is that neither Keaton nor Douglas nor director Rob Reiner can find anything better to do.
rotten," The movie isn't Cliffs Notes, so much as it is a fast-food drive-thru for a classic novel. Beautifully filmed and its costumes are seamless, though the story's not."
fresh, Graced by an alternately unflappable and perturbed performance by Benedict Cumberbatch. The script sparks and flares with passages of clever British speech of lovely theatrical obviousness.
fresh, An overly entertaining experience. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh," Greengrass understands the action framework like few others, locking you into his central figure's cause and dynamism from the git go. His action moves with near frantic drive, logically, smartly and with trim intensity."
rotten," The Tom Clancy-Lite plot is disposable and dated... and the action, when it does arrive, is quiet enough to send the most insomnia-plagued of audiences to sleep."
fresh," A beautifully shot, emotionally engaging smalltown crime drama with a pair of terrific performances from Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper ..."
rotten, Broken Embraces is Almodovar on autopilot.
fresh," Drive Angry 3D is a hoot, as long as you down-shift your brain into neutral and submit to the endless barrage of obscenities and gratuitous violence."
rotten, This is truly a story I'd rather go to the library and read then watch again.
rotten," If you're going to set your comedy in the same universe as the classic '80s comedies of John Hughes, you better make sure your movie is good enough to withstand the comparison."
fresh," Through Columbus's eyes, Rent is beautiful, passionate, toe tapping, stirring, and reflective, following the lead set by the Broadway show and taking it to even greater heights."
rotten," The team who made The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy display plenty of whirligig energy, if not much control or lightness of touch."
fresh," The city becomes a living emblem of the tense coexistence of art and corporatism, an uneasy relationship which Almereyda emphasizes as the core conflict of his picture."
rotten," Instead, it's a rather pompous, disappointing one, and a squandered opportunity to boot."
rotten, It stirs memories less of John le Carre and more of Yakov Smirnoff.
rotten," Seth Rogen, Anthony Mackie and Joseph Gordon-Levitt rip a page from Charles Dickens and Timothy Leary in a well-intended holiday comedy that would have been Scrooged if not for Michael Shannon's performance as angelic weed dealer"
rotten, But who was the previous owner [of Matias' laptop]? Let's just say finding out was too nasty for me. 
fresh," It's cute, it's funny, it's exciting, and it'll remind you why you ever spent hours of your childhood dreaming about what might dwell in the basement or beneath the sink."
rotten," A heavy subject -- a patriotic town in denial over the grief for its combat dead -- uncomfortably saddled to a formulaic ""kids gotta dance"" high school musical"
fresh," The look, the ladies and the con are all here. Here's why Ocean's 8 is less than the sum of its cool parts."
fresh," An engrossing, intricately plotted, superbly crafted shock drama of the highest order."
rotten, The celebrity cameos range from the expected to the embarrassing to the downright baffling...
fresh, Pretentious? Narcissistic? Gory? What's Not to Love?
fresh, It's a delightful blend of past styles and songs that adds a much-needed zest to a dry and dreary movie season.
fresh," Ambitious and divisive, as art should be. "
fresh," Offbeat, hilarious and gleefully misanthropic, this is the perfect antidote to Hollywood's annual glut of sugary Christmas movies."
fresh," Enjoy it for the handsome wide-screen vistas, the interplay of the actors, the classical sweep of its story line. Just don't expect the new, soul-searching Eastwood to be any more dramatically convincing than the old."
fresh," Natali explores this hoary theme with apt, flippant gravity, updating it with canny hipness, but subjecting it to too many mutations to bring it fully to life."
fresh," A Simple Favor reintroduces Lively as a character actress-a sexy, funny, award-worthy revelation."
fresh," It's a handsome and, at times, riveting procedural. And unlike other films that casually approach the subject of justice and revenge, resolving that a gun is the simple answer, Akin is determined to offer up a word of caution."
rotten, Feels like a random series of fantastical and often beautiful but still very random events. 
fresh, Pink is largely a triumph -- a Bollywood film that talks about a burning topic and finds an entertaining way to do it.
rotten, The cumulative effect is one of spectacle over substance.
rotten," The film goes off the rails in the final third, sacrificing subtle character work at the altar of blood-and-guts survival horror. As mood-killers go, it's like a jab to the back of the neck."
fresh," The superb ensemble of veteran Israeli actors, singers and comedians gives bravura performances."
fresh," Rome is complicated, emotional, [with] entertaining moments, perfect technique, but above all, is beautiful. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh, It's no classic but the animation is lively and inventive with some terrifically realised ghouls and the story moves fast.
fresh," ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower'' is the sort of lower- budget personal film you hardly see being released by a major distributor anymore, except during awards season."
rotten," A very '90s take on a 1660s tale written in 1850, as a picture of early colonial life it's about as convincing as Pocahontas."
rotten, The Glass Castle is 100% tone-deaf and has no idea how to functionally tell the very raw and personal story at its core
rotten," And I then ask you, if I don't believe in the characters, their romance, their conflicts, and find the entire film predictable, what is left?"
rotten, Mediocre family fare that's simply not that much fun.
rotten," What a nightmare! ""A Haunted House 2″ is the kind of film that gives lowbrow comedy a bad name. It's just like the original, screamingly stupid."
fresh," It's dastardly clever and entirely plausible, although the end does push the boundaries to the limit."
fresh, It leaves the audience in the same place as the characters: gasping for air.
fresh," Delivering on its promise, Predators is a moody, unrelenting and attention-grabbing sci-fi thriller, filled with action, splendid visual effects and packed with undulating tension"
rotten, We're now two-for-two on films in this series that really feel like they ought to be doing more than just presenting the same old shocks in online drag.
fresh," However diffuse the movie's agenda, it is never less than thoroughly involving."
fresh, The easygoing comedy keeps a familiar story going despite minor plot hiccups.
rotten," For an actor who has spent his career embodying unclassifiable human enigmas, it's unfortunate that [Gary Oldman] and Wright chose to depict Churchill in such broad, deliberate strokes. "
rotten," Very much a live-action cartoon (albeit one just Dark 'n Gritty enough to merit a PG-13 rating), right down to lines like, ""Drain all of their blood - even if it kills them!"" "
fresh, This well directed film shows an uncompromising yet faithful look at the horrible teen years.
rotten," While there's nothing terribly wrong with it, there's not much that's memorable either."
fresh, What Greengrass excels at is action - taut and visceral - and it happens as soon as the captain suddenly looks at a screen and sees two small dots moving toward the ship.
rotten," More science-fiction-y than most superhero films with some cool intergalactic visuals, the story can't quite make the most of Ryan Reynolds' charisma..."
rotten," In Yosemite, life might be difficult, confusing and painful. But it also never really seems worth living"
fresh," We've had to wait this long for Rourke and Downey to share the screen, and when they finally do, they're turned into action figures."
fresh, Velvet Buzzsaw aims at an easy target -- the commodification of art -- but the movie's cast produces enjoyable results.
fresh, One of the most exciting and classic recent productions from Spain. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten," Director Andy Fickman opts against subtlety at every turn. A score filled with heavy strings and the occasional ringing of chimes telegraphs all emotional cues, practically willing the water out of your tear ducts."
rotten," Watching this, your cerebral activity may not be as intense as usual."
fresh," I love it when films genuinely surprise me...this is something different, and it's a fun time at the movies."
fresh," Gyllenhaal, long one of the most underrated actors, shows once again that he can take on an exceptionally challenging role and bring enormous depth and authenticity."
fresh," Jenkins, working with cinematographer James Laxton, makes us feel as if we're right there with Chiron, using handheld cameras that flow sporadically, yet delicately, in and out of scenes."
rotten," Most gags are very old, rundown and have seen better days."
fresh," Intriguing, well-structured and mildly engaging with strong performances, but its balance of comedy, melodrama and romance feels slightly uneven and contrived."
rotten," Early on in the movie, Myers' guru character, Pitka, is doing yoga and literally sticks his head up his own rear end. There could be no more apt metaphor for what ensues onscreen"
rotten," If the animation studio Blue Sky has proven anything so far, it's that they're big league visual artists, but frankly pedestrian when it comes to stories."
fresh," Although prone to occasional sermonizing, The Post offers a stirring reminder of the importance of these kinds of unsung heroes in protecting the American way of life."
rotten, Country Strong weak in the story department.
rotten," ... It's all surface level a backdrop for a big, dumb action movie that has more in common with ""The Expendables"" than ""L.A. Confidential."""
fresh," I don't doubt that anyone who has had a brush with AIDS, lost a friend or even a hero like Queen's Freddie Mercury, will find what is already a socially curious, medically fascinating and politically charged film an unmissably emotional experience."
fresh," In this bleak West Texas landscape where everyone seems to be struggling, you find yourself rooting, inexplicably, for all of them against a clear villain: the faceless, predatory bank."
fresh," After two continent-wide trips and a plunge into the French capital's underworld, French director Cédric Klapisch stays close to home and well above the ground for Paris, his valentine to the City of Lights."
rotten," Both Fox and Seyfried are hobbled somewhat by the heavy-handed direction of Karyn Kusama, a gifted filmmaker who seems unwilling to surrender to the exploitive trashiness of Cody's juicily derivative script."
fresh," At the center of it is Pacino, totally authentic among Green's amateur actors in this rough-around-the-edges world of beaten-up bars and restaurants with crappy plastic furniture. Now, someone give the man a more decent film."
fresh, [An] amiable and rather enjoyable dance comedy ...
rotten, An almost excessively beautiful aestheticization of misery.
fresh," You have to hand it to Spacey. He gets by on sheer willfulness. He believes so much in his cockeyed dream that we come to believe in it, too."
fresh, 'Sobrio y fino trabajo fílmico que demuestra un prometedor inicio de carrera de un joven cineasta que puede ofrecer cosas interesantes a futuro. Verdaderamente recomendable'
rotten," While there are smart lines and amusing sequences, the whole business becomes tiresome, then distasteful and, finally, a tad repugnant."
fresh," Melville views it all at a distance and with a slow kind of precision that is missing from modern movies. There's no flash here, just criminal behavior observed with an eye for detail."
fresh," Sweet, and almost as much fun as Fierce Creatures."
rotten," The problem is that we've been given nothing to make us care for any of these people, so when the mysteries unravel there's nothing in the answers that hit us at a gut level."
rotten, Butler is neither sympathetic nor sinister enough for this hokum to wash.
rotten, A B-grade Scream wannabe.
fresh," The movie has less biting originality than The Truman Show, but it proves that director Ross retains screenwriter Ross's flair for exploring real-life issues through divertingly far-fetched plots."
rotten," While not hitting the heights it could have, Where Hands Touch is a reminder that there are plenty of stories from this era that have yet to be told."
rotten," There's no deeper significance, no clever mind game played on the audience, no commentary on violence. Frankly, it's kinda dull."
rotten, Oliver Schmitz's film... does not clarify what he wants to be. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten," What little edge this tale had has been rubbed right off for this stale, slow and mirthless sequel"
fresh, The film is less focused on men who hurt women and more concerned about men and women who threaten the world order.
fresh, There has never been and may never be again a story so electrifying over so many pages that has been so devotedly and expertly translated to the screen.
rotten," The Legend of Tarzan has a top-shelf cast, stunning visual effects and a sumptuous look - everything, really, except a reason for being."
fresh," The elements don't hang together, but Kasdan delivers real scares, and real hoots, in the midst of the mayhem and madness."
rotten," Given this is one of the first movies that we can think of that covers sleep-paralysis in such detail, it should be fresh and invigorate the genre, instead it plods along ticking off all the expected, but uninteresting, boxes."
fresh, Honest. Real. One of the best pictures of the year.
fresh," Likely to be dismissed by many, it's a charming film that feels like a love letter to an earlier time while also toying with our contemporary proclivities. Easily Jolie's finest work to date."
rotten," The players flap, mug and pratfall. Then they flap, mug and pratfall some more. The script is an open text: they can bring their own jokes. The audience is still waiting for one when the film closes."
rotten," A huge disappointment after Baumbach's sublime ""'Squid and the Whale."" Ugly, murky, and mean."
rotten," With one exception, director Patricia Riggen follows a pretty standard playbook, making this a mediocre cinematic experience despite its dramatic real life events."
fresh," ... a mess, but a cheerful one."
fresh, The 3-D is underwhelming; the movie's not so bad.
rotten," Carl T. Evans's semi-autobiographical film is a modern-day Big Chill wannabe without the subtlety, humor, memorable soundtrack, strong performances or convincing dialogue."
fresh," By shooting this film over 12 years, writer-director Richard Linklater is able to explore family dynamics in an intensely involving way that's never been seen on-screen before."
rotten," The sober, relatively uninspired account of a real-life crime that shook postwar London."
rotten," There is just so much bad...but there are a few really funny, cute, good moments...do me a favor and end this franchise."
fresh," Zorro follows the predictable paths of action movies, but re-energizes the pattern with adrenaline, exuberance, creativity, and humor."
rotten, If only the dialogue and visuals matched the daring of its ideology.
rotten," ""The Final Girls"" is never once scary, the effects are schlocky, and the action/fight scenes are confusing, especially one that takes place in a dark shack where it is impossible to tell what is happening."
rotten," Steeped in an authentic sense of place, this crime drama is less convincing on the storytelling front."
rotten, I wish more attention had been focused on Marsh's Ukrainian friend Igor Kurilets's struggles with the country's proudly anachronistic medical establishment.
fresh," For the first hour or more, The Hurt Locker boldly forsakes any conventional narrative hook beyond the ongoing tensions between these men and the terrifying grind of defusing bombs day after day."
rotten," As he sits there regaling tales of his youth ... insulting everyone who ever gave him the time of day, and trying to eke fame and money out of an illegal act, I found him a deeply uncomfortable watch."
rotten, The film bears a closer resemblance to a shooter video game than an actual movie.
fresh, Blue Jasmine is Woody Allen at the top of his game.
rotten, A well-intended melodrama that's as soggy as a firehose. 
rotten," Here's hoping TLAM 3, if there is one, remembers what the T stands for."
rotten," I appreciate what Almodovar was trying to do, but this comedy is just too broad for its own good."
fresh, Gregory might have done a bit more to differentiate this more extensive investigation from those earlier pics' conventions. But the richness of the tale told here makes this competently packaged feature a keeper nonetheless.
rotten," Parental Guidance feels like it's been thoughtlessly written in a boardroom strictly as a vehicle for Crystal to perform the same past-due routines he does at the Oscars, musical numbers and all."
fresh," ...Glenn Gould's life gets a thoughtful but perhaps too respectful consideration in this layered, slightly overlong documentary."
fresh, Insightful and intriguing coming-of-age comedic drama...
rotten," That's one thing that Ritchie's Legend in the Sword shared with Excalibur-a vague idea that Britain is destined for transformation. In Legend of the Sword, unfortunately, that transformation is little more than a teaser."
fresh," An attitude bazooka full of sex, drugs and raw language, yet so high on babies and family values that this must be the first R-rated film for both sleazoid slackers and earnest right-to-lifers."
rotten, ...the location is where Peli's inspiration started and stopped.
rotten, Never mind plot: a lot of it isn't even comprehensible.
fresh," It's a true triumph of observation, evocation, allusion and delicate craft."
rotten," In spite of efforts to instill in our young women the notion that self-worth shouldn't be measured by her ability to attract a husband, filmmakers continue to craft comedy from that very outmoded belief."
rotten," Even in down seasons, a Thursday block of ""The Office"" and ""30 Rock"" delivers better writing, tighter direction and more laughs than 88 minutes of ""Date Night."" For free."
rotten, This is the very definition of the kind of movie where fans of the star will enjoy it more than dispassionate observers.
fresh," It quickly becomes clear in this film that ""Diana Vreeland"" invented herself. She is a marvelous creation and totally original."
rotten," Some 'smart people' can be thick as planks...and this is a fragmented, derivative, predictablly underwhelming family drama."
fresh," Maybe Bond is still an action figure whose default setting is beating up bad guys, pulling out a gun and running across roofs. But if boys have to be boys, it's a huge relief to know the new Bond age is confident enough to keep them conflicted about it."
rotten," Floria Sigismondi's mixed-bag debut feature, though offering nightmarish sequences in which the teens are clearly in over their heads, merely skims the surface."
fresh," For all of the film's delicately structured character arcs and hushed visual poetry, Ida never completely connects, and Pawlikowski's cinematic reserve often feels arid and passionless."
fresh, The series is both a testimonial to the vagaries of chance and an endlessly cyclical study into the implications of being studied.
rotten, Thank goodness for all those still extra special effects and filmmaking magicians behind the scenes. They just might keep some wandering minds away from such convoluted storytelling.
rotten," Despite the best efforts of some solid character actors, a muddled plot means this self-help themed film neither engages nor entertains."
rotten," There's a loose charm to this comedy that disarms the audience, raising smiles instead of laughter as three nutty characters swirl around each other. "
fresh, Stone has a glittering career as a leading lady ahead of her.
fresh," While it's a bit of a slow burner, Mendelsohn is so compelling, there's really no need for things to speed up."
rotten," Beat movies are just a sign that a new wave of such whiners has arrived to see them, and, because movies take years to make, is probably already progressing beyond the adolescent obsessions that the moviemakers thought to capitalize on."
rotten," The most startling thing about it is that anyone thought this story needed telling a third time -- and not just one anyone, but a group of them had to come to this crackpot conclusion. "
rotten," Digital filmmaking has a lot to answer for - much of it good, but a lot of it bad. Its biggest crime, however, may be eradicating David Cronenberg of style."
rotten," Lurid, pointless thriller teases us with a teenaged girl's sexual and mortal peril, creating awful suspense around her abuse. Her terror is your titillation."
rotten, A lot of sentimental hogwash about fathers and sons heading off to war. 
fresh, It's a juicy idea but it ends up playing out like an extended tv movie
rotten, Hedonism deserves better representation.
fresh, Andie MacDowell [displays] one of the best performances of her career.
fresh, Brings a distinctive perspective to familiar themes...
rotten," A Walk Among the Tombstones is your standard, traditional Noir flick; in other words, it feels pretty dated."
rotten, There comes a point where the difference between bad-on-purpose and just-plain-bad is wholly academic.
rotten, Goosebumps 2 is in far too much of a hurry - and perhaps too eager to be widely accessible - to be actually scary or wholly effective.
rotten," The premise isn't even worthy of executive producer Guillermo del Toro, who will apparently lend his name to any film as long as it fulfills its quota of moths and vulvic openings."
rotten," Chemistry counts for something, and Robert Redford and Sissy Spacek have it in spades in the trifling-at-best, galling-at-worst dramedy The Old Man & the Gun. "
fresh," Two very different men, joined for purely businesslike purposes, finding their way to an intuitive, interdependent and quietly fulfilling union."
rotten," Writers didn't know what to do with Barbara back in 1988, and they don't know now."
rotten, There's a special kind of effort that must go into turning out a flick this impossibly bad.
rotten," It's a bad movie, which means its toxic politics have no plausible defense. "
fresh," Matt Ross has crafted a truly fantastic tale of the joy of living in the wild while physically training and home schooling a brood of children, far from the madding crowd."
fresh," The film's patient, naturalistic depiction of teen life - created over eight months of character workshopping with the young cast - simply doesn't allow for ideological grandstanding. "
rotten," Charmless and witless, this tiresome comedy fails as notalgic tribute to the beloved TV series and as contempo reimagining due to lack of chemistry between Ferrell and Kidman"
fresh," Scenes take on a surreal nightmare quality, sometimes with no accompanying sound, as even the camera seems dazed by what it is witnessing."
rotten," The film becomes such a gore fest of bloody events, it becomes laugh-inducing. Thus I can't even remotely call SUSPIRIA entertaining."
rotten, Its denunciation of rich-nation profiteering at the expense of poor-nation exploitation has you ready to pull your 'enough already' ripcord.
fresh, Moderately successful attempt to capture the spirit of silent movie comedy with claymation sheep. More clever than outright funny.
rotten, a weird and wonderful but narratively lacking post-apocalyptic fantasy
fresh," Slices into the darkness of every scene with a razor's edge of finely calibrated suspense, tension, grief, paranoia and primal fear."
fresh," ""Tyrel"" is a lab experiment with no insight into feelings of otherness beyond the blinding light directed at its wigged-out subject."
fresh," It is a silly film, but it is fun to watch."
rotten," It's big and brash, but were it not for Weta's visionary special effects work, there would be little to keep the blood pumping."
fresh," The performances and laughs are enough to make This Is Where I Leave You enjoyable, provided you can overlook the shallowness and frequent sitcom compulsions."
fresh," The dancing is the star of any of these movies, and Sie knows when to get out of the way and let it do the heavy lifting."
rotten, The only thing this film has going for it are pretty faces and even the demographic those faces are geared towards attracting will be onto Caruso's nonsense.
rotten, A mishmash of ideas in search of a movie.
rotten," a new story out of Carroll's mythmaking that fails to inspire interest, perhaps except as a rote exercise in mainstream weirdness."
rotten," ""The Goods"" has to imply an antonym as it is far from good. Despite starring the Emmy award winning Jeremy Piven, the writing destroyed any chance of success."
fresh, I don't know why this is so scattershot at the beginning... but in time it becomes a proper successor at least in the second half.
rotten," The new characters' voices are even more grating and annoying than in previous installments, and some of the animation seems downright archaic."
rotten," Indifferent to [F. Scott] Fitzgerald's ideas about society and ambition, Fincher falls back on Hollywood cliché -- reworking both Titanic and Forrest Gump."
fresh," A movie about representation in a multitude of ways, all successful."
fresh, Definitely seaworthy again. All aboard.
fresh," The 'remake factor' aside, with Straw Dogs Lurie has created an enjoyable but flawed film. Audiences who are unfamiliar with the original will certainly be entertained."
rotten, Its familiar story passes with nothing to distinguish itself from the many other similarly plotted movies and sitcoms.
fresh," Debut director Ejiofor gives us a unique perspective. Reminiscent of Oscar winner ""Tsotsi,"" or the gut-wrenching, perfect film ""Moolaadé,"" this is a story that should be explored."
fresh," It's easy to root for the inspirational youngsters, whose moving stories just might change your perspective regarding inclusion and disabilities."
fresh," With his sense of predestination, [director] Solondz is like the Sam Shepard of sterile suburban strip malls."
fresh," Romantic, inventive, visually dazzling - and yet, Damien Chazelle's ambitious movie promises slightly more than it delivers."
fresh," Setting fascism against freedom, and hiding the devil in its details, this feature debut is an ambitious, sophisticated passion play that leaves Ron Howard's dumb-assed The Da Vinci Code (2006) in its dust."
rotten," Stars Justin Timberlake, the perfect vanilla pseudoadult for a story of pseudoadult intrigues and pleasures."
rotten," Persistently baffling, contrived, and often simply bizarre -- a highbrow misfire of the most peculiar sort."
rotten," We get a brief dip into his family's past and emigration from Israel, but the filmmaker never digs deeply enough to reveal any other substantial dimension of this man, or her theories about what shaped him."
fresh," The animation itself is startlingly beautiful, as is the ancient owl world it imagines. The battles are complex and, in true Snyder tradition, heavy on the action."
fresh, The film's end credits feature more unbridled creativity than most films employ in their entireties.
fresh," Nothing would work, though, without the appealing Baruchel."
fresh, Weitz's film moves from clunky domestic dramedy to genuine feminist odyssey.
rotten, A game cast and lots of gamey R-rated shenanigans can't compensate for the silly comic contrivances that dominate The Big Wedding.
fresh, Fans of movies like The Wedding Planner and You've Got Mail looking for a charming date movie with lots of laughs will fall in love with Hitch.
rotten," There's no emotional punch to The Lullaby, just a dulling gloominess."
rotten," ...this drama, under the skillful direction of Stephen Daldry, aims to do more than merely arouse our latent emotions."
rotten, The setting is the sleepy American town of Dullsville.
fresh, ...perfect for those who prefer down-and-dirty crime films to overstuffed costumed productions.
rotten," Beyond its 'How far can I go?' attitude to violence, Hostel has no reason to exist."
fresh," The film surprises you because apart from being hysterically jaw dropping funny, its' ideologies and themes throughout are somehow inexplicably meaningful."
fresh," This superstar crime thriller emerges as something surprising, fascinating and technically dazzling. Don't expect a Hollywood movie. Expect a Michael Mann movie."
rotten," You're left with a lovingly rendered portrait of a cipher, a protagonist who never lets you in and therefore one in whom you can't invest too much emotion."
fresh," Sheds further light on the Beales with footage shot before the making of ""Grey Gardens."""
rotten," Just when the baseball slapstick starts wearing thin, a final-reel gush of truly cynical sentiment on behalf of the physically challenged sends the ordeal-factor off the scale."
rotten," If you're bored and want to see a summer popcorn flick, The Mummy might be mildly satisfying."
fresh," The other actors do their best to help Fiennes define this curious anti-hero. Incapable of playing the role of peacetime compromiser, his Coriolanus comes across as a warrior who simply can't function without a war."
rotten," Becky a remarkable Plucky Girl, determined but also charming, clueless but also deeply insightful, and of course, played by the dazzling Rachel McAdams. "
rotten, An empty box with very appealing wrapping paper.
rotten, The film does have its pleasures. Roach is warm and convincing (with a proper Welsh accent) and the script occasionally sparkles.
rotten," An unsatisfying hybrid of Blair Witch and typical stalk-and-slash fare, where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living."
fresh, It's a sweet story about how friendship and imagination can help us get through the tough times of life- especially as young children.
fresh, Kubrick's sci-fi masterpiece is still relevant.
fresh," This is that rare film where a daring style is connected to real substance, and that's an exciting thing to experience in a first-time director."
fresh," Is The Next Three Days implausible? You betcha. Tell that to the magnetic stars, the smart screenplay and the impassioned direction by Paul Haggis."
rotten," In all fairness, Albert Camus' short story L'hote (The Guest) may be too spare and lean to fill a full-length feature film. But also in all fairness, it captures its issues in a far more concise and eloquent manner then David Oelhoffen's film."
rotten," Aparentemente, Danny Boyle encontra-se encantado demais pelas possibilidades da lógica visual que criou para se incomodar com a (falta de) lógica da história que está contando. "
fresh," Hi-tech gadgets, jungle combat, vehicle chases, ready-made quips, casino hookups - there's something very James Bond-esque about Black Panther."
rotten," Among the laughably bad lines is one uttered by The Conscience. 'When does the pain end and the pleasure begin?' he asks Joan. For The Messenger's audience, it is as soon as the ending credits begin to roll."
fresh," Despite its narrative problems, Disappearance is a bold statement on the state of healthcare in Iran and the lack of agency women have over their bodies."
fresh," It's generally compelling, even if the film seems to target the financially savvy more than the working-class folks who are most affected by the events it chronicles."
rotten," Please, don't stand up on our account."
rotten," I never got into this. Very slow, dated special effects, and obvious exploration of the paranoia theme."
fresh," Devised by acting-writing comedy team Lowe and Oram and co-scripted by Amy Jump, director Ben Wheatley's professional and personal partner, the movie pokes fun at the social limitations of these lumpen Midlanders without sneering at or patronizing them."
rotten, The film has a plot twist that would've been effective and save the movie if it didn't come so late. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten," A confused, unrefined agitprop movie."
rotten, A good performance by Charlize Theron is all that saves this movie from the poverty porn dustbin.
fresh, Horror's goal is simply delivering fun. The thrill of constant frights releases rollercoaster-level endorphins the fans can't get enough of the rush. Blood Fest shoves it right in our faces and then some.
fresh," Monster House is a cute, fun and smart stroll down the universal adolescent memory lane, a sort of haunted Home Alone or a Leave It to Beaver episode set in The Twilight Zone."
rotten," Because Re-Animator is so poorly acted and directed (by Stuart Gordon, whose first film this is), there is no tension to break. So the gruesome scenes are just clinical and dull."
rotten," I'm sorry, but having no mythical beasts in a film about the greatest mythical beast-slayer ever is pretty much a money-back scenario for me. I kept thinking: where are the monsters?"
fresh, Suspenseful zigzagging adventure drama has a top-of-his-game Matthew McConaughey as a wired 1980s Reno mining company dreamer salivating for and maybe getting the big strike.
fresh, ... a masterpiece about filial love and the horrors of poverty.
fresh," It's not a disgrace -- indeed, it's not bad if you like that sort of thing -- while not particularly good, and yet it's one of the better horror films I've seen in a long time. "
fresh," The film can't feel as natural, given its script's adherence to a well-worn formula. Still, it does take on a lightheaded, dreamlike quality that makes it gently romantic."
rotten," An intriguing, if flawed look at the nature of obsession."
rotten," There is inelegance here between expression and meaning that is jarring, and makes this a grim watch at times."
fresh," Uplifting, heart-warming, hilarious... not necessarily words you'd expect to apply to a black and white silent French film. But The Artist is no ordinary movie."
fresh," One consistent is the sweet, tenderness on show, diluting the more severe, poignant aspects with a geniality that ensures this remains an undemanding, entertaining piece of cinema."
rotten," Leaving behind the laughs for schmaltz, Hancock chickens out at the last minute, lurching toward a cop-out happy ending that gives every indication of having been reshot at the behest of test audiences. Well, at least you won't be bored."
rotten, This chaotic mess of a film ... has the disjointed quality of a stoned-out fantasy.
rotten," ""Bad Teacher"" is a pulled punch, a pot-smoking/kid cussing/teacher copulating farce that is less than the sum of its parts."
rotten, Displays atypical laziness and tone-deaf direction for a feature concerning the electric boogaloo secrets of the underprivileged.
fresh," Greengrass has embraced the risk inherent in turning a true, unpopular story into a mainstream entertainment, but he can't quite handle the responsibility."
rotten, Obsessed is both a front runner for the worst movie of the year and a must-see stinker.
rotten, Its copious amounts of cinematic flaws actually render it borderline incoherent and an absolute chore to sit through.
fresh," The Coen brothers...shape the parched, timeless Tex-Mex borderland into a character itself, a place where good and evil alike swelter under the sun, and the prairie wind whistles by uncaring."
fresh," In the bizarre and singularly delightful My Winnipeg, [director Guy] Maddin offers a docu-history of his hometown, entangled with memories of his childhood."
rotten," Although skillfully overhyped, this asinine exercise is little more than a way for Affleck and Phoenix to write off blow and hookers."
fresh," ... possesses a primeval power to get under your skin, if not necessarily stay in your mind much beyond its brief running time."
fresh," Like its young heroine, The Hate U Give is earnest, impassioned and spoiling to be heard."
rotten," An episodic, sketchy comedy-drama that reaches for the stars... but settles for the balcony."
rotten, About as much fun as watching a weather report.
fresh," Shyamalan is a master of mood, tone and style, like Hitchcock, and keeps the scary bits off screen, which in this desensitized world, makes them all the more frightening."
rotten," ""Hillsong's"" biggest worry is ""being underwhelming."" Are you ready for some bad news, kids?"
rotten, What it's not is a takedown of the underlying problems that fuel obesity in America.
rotten, Here's hoping X-Men: Days of Future Past can restore Singer to his former glory - it's become easy to forget that he was essentially the JJ Abrams of the noughties - because this dim-witted action fable isn't going to cut it.
fresh," As a showcasing of the evolution of such a remarkable career, Looking for Light is a stimulating distillation of a life captured on celluloid and a woman who thrived in a predominantly male-driven industry."
rotten," Like something you peer at rather than absorb, ""Salt and Fire"" is both awful and a tad fascinating."
fresh, Jordan Peele's follow-up to Get Out unnervingly speaks to the issues affecting a divided nation.
fresh, The best vignette finds Peter Cushing delivering one of the best performances of his long career.
fresh," The script is lean, cliché-free and enigmatic, especially an extended, poetic scene set in an Upper West Side bathroom that will terrify you, then break your heart."
fresh," If the new film looks and sounds much cheaper than Mr. Hartley's earlier work, the writer and director's wit remains intact."
fresh, The Holocaust has been the subject of many films. The Pianist is one of the great ones.
fresh, Level 16 is a compelling thriller that serves as a powerful metaphor for the unnatural standards society places on women
rotten," A tedious, pandering time-waster."
fresh," Israeli documentary goes a long way toward bringing together perspectives scattered through other films, particularly interviews with new generation of determined fanatics."
fresh, Such is the world of Disneyfication.
fresh," Brace yourself for something more sophisticated and ... adult. The Incredibles is not cut from the same touchy-feely ... mold as Toy Story, Monsters Inc. or Finding Nemo. "
fresh," [Allows] Fincher to shine as the skilled, stylish director that he is."
fresh, It works in large part because of the swell cast.
fresh, The film's spin toward a liberal audience means it chokes into ineffectuality when it tries to take a less ironic and more active stance on society's biggest current white whale.
fresh," Jennifer Lawrence is the straw that stirs this dystopic drink, her sincerity far greater than the material deserves..."
fresh," Mustang is incendiary and intimate, enraging and sweet."
rotten," There are triumphs, both in front of and behind the camera, but they often get overshadowed by a story that tries to do too much."
rotten," Webber brings the politics and intrigue to the fore in a gripping final act, but the overall impression is that a fascinating story from history has been lost in the telling."
fresh," Even if the movie's logic ultimately spirals down into a vortex of hysteria, horror and hokum, I enjoyed the bulldozer intensity of the climax, which barely keeps a lid on the crackpot cult movie that's wrestling for the soul of this... blockbuster."
rotten, The swipes from pseudo-science and more inventive films serve only to put a thin gloss on the thin plot.
fresh, An ideal film for both bookwormy kids and tech-savvy parents.
fresh," A virtuoso achievement for everyone involved whose final credits actually read ""Music by Clint Eastwood"". If a more apropos coda could exist, I couldn't think of one."
rotten, Well-acted but increasingly either melodramatic or just plain dull.
fresh," 100 Bloody Acres is extremely funny comedy for viewers who can handle bloodshed, death and yappy little dogs being kicked across the room. (No dogs were harmed in the making of this film.)"
rotten," Whose life, Wesley asks in the movie's narration, is he living? Judging from all the sterile office and apartment space and his mile-long face, I'd say Bruce Willis's in ""The Sixth Sense.''"
rotten, It's a stupid movie by smart people who aren't smart enough to realize it's stupid.
rotten," A smutty script and a passel of objectionable characters form an imperfect rom-com union - one that will, with any luck, fade from the mind long before its title suggests."
fresh," It is likeable, and has some moments of truthfulness underneath the clichés."
fresh, 22 July is not an easy movie to watch but it's one you should consider giving your time to.
fresh," Like Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing, it is designed to inspire discussion rather than solve problems."
rotten," The experience of watching it is something like lounging on a satin divan, being fanned lazily with a bouquet of ostrich plumes."
fresh, ...deftly mixes comedy with adventure and romance to make this an extremely well-rounded film.
fresh," Whoever thought to merge ""Snow White"" with ""Revenge of the Nerds"" had a clever idea there. And you can watch it unfold in ""Sydney White."""
fresh," Dark Skies has almost nothing to do with dark skies but it is a quietly effective little horror movie, with an exceptional cast and a couple of decent scares."
fresh," Beautifully shot, tediously paced, it's worth consideration if only for Heath Ledger's devastating performance as a despairing man done in by time and circumstance."
rotten," [It's] admittedly funnier than the 2006 original. But that movie was so dispiritingly, soul-suckingly bad, there was nowhere left to go but up."
fresh, Don't listen to the haters -- this linguistically complex and eloquently dark film is much more clever than pretentious.
rotten," The only reason the film should draw your attention is to catch the great Helen Mirren, who despite her usual fine acting can't save this dull drama."
fresh, La cinta resulta demasiado oscura para ser un producto devenido del mundo de los comics.
rotten," The film needed further salvation. Fanning excels as a sleeping beauty slowly awakening, but Thompson and Wise are both miscast. "
fresh," Cage's performance didn't develop or change, it just falls in the right place, where his crazy reactions & over the top acting become traits that help the film & distinguish him."
rotten," It's almost like they said: I know, let's create a great setup for a mismatched buddy road comedy thing...and that was about all the thought that went into it."
fresh, Coco is dealing with life and death in ways that will genuinely move just about anyone that watches it
rotten, There are some pretty sadistic torture scenes for the gore hounds -- but ultimately this pointless prequel is about as thrilling as a wet towel.
rotten, Not even the able actors that Glanz somehow managed to rope into his project can do much with the draggy story and the vapid characters that they have been given to play.
rotten, A wonderful idea that simply does not result in a wonderful film.
rotten," It's not that ""Runner Runner"" is predictable. It's that you don't care, either about the characters or what happens to them."
fresh," The Nice Guys is very much in the Kiss Kiss Bang Bang vein - part thriller, part spoof. And Crowe and Gosling turn out to be very funny, embellishing their performances with some noteworthy '70s fashion items."
fresh," An amazing piece of writing and one that will provoke laughs, discussion and anger."
fresh, Heartwarming and hilarious.
rotten," If only the movie's cast of ordinary working stiffs weren't quite so bland and, frankly, dull."
rotten," Sets its intergalactic sights so lowbrow that its infantile humor and wide-eyed, hammy acting almost succeed as a parody of Marvel superhero bonding films. But not quite."
fresh," Romeo And Juliet it ain't, but as a solid love story, New Moon gets the blood pumping."
fresh," Paul Rudd's ability to keep ex-con/single-dad/reluctant superhero Scott Lang simultaneously sceptical, confused and committed to the sci-fi chaos around him without ever going boringly square-jawed is nothing less than the purest movie-star charisma."
fresh," Big Fish is a clever, smart fantasy that targets the child inside every adult, without insulting the intelligence of either."
fresh," Coogan arguably does his finest acting work to date, while Reilly, heavily made up with extra poundage, locates a particular twinkle in the eye that will be instantly recognisable to fans. A masterful double-act in its own right. "
rotten, Colombiana never successfully builds off the emotions established in its strong opening.
rotten," Keaton gives a manic, slapstick performance that alternates between being merely bad and being embarrassingly bad. Her work has an unbearable finger-across-the-blackboard effect."
rotten, A work of unintelligent design.
fresh," Hardy makes for a compelling psychological tour guide, utilizing much more than his right foot to add forward momentum."
fresh," A stylish, violent and engaging thriller that draws on the best of Tarantino, and with nods to Tony Scott's True Romance, My Father Die is one to seek out as soon as possible."
fresh," Absolutely solid family entertainment, Dreamer: Inspired by a True Story is corn-fed, wholesome and thoroughly satisfying."
rotten, Fast Five is grindingly mechanical -- and not just because of all the emphasis on car repairs and retooling.
rotten," It's hard to imagine that the movie has much to say to viewers less than enthusiastic about Giger's imagery - macabre, aggressively sexual mergings of organic and mechanical forms."
rotten," Sadly, Mr. Butler lacks the wit and the range to convey anything other than grouchy belligerence, and the script, by Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt, seems intent on squandering opportunities to be clever or interesting."
fresh, Topnotch escapist entertainment.
fresh," There is an essential decency to all Howard's movies, and Rush is no different."
fresh, The movie's rewards outpace its flaws by a mile and give us another reason to follow the career of a gifted young lead actor.
fresh," What is most unexpected about Permission is its sense of poignancy and tenderness. In its own way, it's quite heartbreaking."
fresh, A frighteningly funny satire that finds humour in historical horror. Watch and feel better about the world.
fresh," If you're looking for a review that will tell you the movie is terrible and its fans are idiots, I'm afraid I must disappoint you. "
rotten," McG and his leading ladies captured something in a bottle [in the first film], and `Full Throttle' feels like they're trying to force that something back in."
fresh," It is, in its unworldly way, sweetly idealistic with a charm all of its own: a teen romance to get your teeth into."
rotten," The plot is ludicrous, which in itself would be perfectly acceptable given sharper handling, but both script and direction devote so much time to romantic undercurrents that the central intrigue is further divested of credibility."
fresh," It's a breezy film masquerading as a sincere one, and while that's obnoxious, it's hard to hate a fun night at the movies."
fresh, If making a film is about dealing with compromises - as so many directors have told us - one of the beauties of Jonze's work is that he doesn't appear to have made many. 
fresh," Rear Window meets the iTunes era in fun, slick suspense pic."
fresh," Another winning Michael Mann character study (see: ""The Insider,"" ""Heat,"" ""Thief"") with Jamie Foxx revelatory in the lead."
rotten," While I recognise the truthful and splendid depiction, like the characters whose lives are depicted, I found the journey frustrating and difficult"
fresh," It's not the movie of the decade, year or even summer, but Zorro has enough going for it to keep you amused and into the story."
fresh," Spectacle for spectacle's sake, but infiltrated by intelligent commentary and an atmosphere of generosity and inclusion."
fresh," Gerwig the actress skillfully pivots between the wacky and the poignant, so it's no surprise that Gerwig the auteur so delicately balances hilarity and heartbreak."
rotten," The Treasure is a one-note film that's a dry, bleak endeavor, devoid of character and lacking personality."
fresh," While Black is painfully effective as the dork who drops slangy kudos on his new BFF, Marsden is a revelation."
fresh, It speaks with the tranquility of a parable.
rotten," Street Kings is an absurd if accidentally entertaining potboiler, based on a story by James Ellroy."
fresh," Grandma is Lily Tomlin in her first lead role since Big Business in 1988 and that's recommendation enough. It's a mix of the erudite, the tough and the goofy."
rotten," If you're a fan of hers you'll be able to find some enjoyment in this movie, but not as much as she seems to be having while making them."
fresh," Its plot is complexity itself, but its ""kids save the world"" soul is simple and earnest as opposed to earth shattering. With apologies to Bill and Ted, it's an excellent adventure, and let's leave it at that."
rotten," I guess it's only fitting that Shyamalan's cameo is credited as ""Jai, Hooters lover."""
fresh," You couldn't call it a hopeful film, exactly. But there is plenty of hope around the edges."
rotten," In some eyes, this is a movie; in others, it's a weapon of mass destruction."
rotten," Even when it inspires laughter it doesn't inspire much else. It isn't involving enough for you to ever truly care about how these many, many problems will resolve themselves, and not funny enough for the experience to be more enjoyable."
rotten, A sloppy excuse for 95 minutes of celluloid . . . Andrew Fleming's film should be outlawed for its sheer laziness alone.
fresh," While it may have been changed for the screen, this story of a family's ordeal is one from which any parent - any person, really - can't turn away. "
fresh, It's a small miracle that a story as filled with tragedy and heartbreak as Precious... would also be as hopeful and life-affirming as it is.
rotten," Muddled, overwrought ..."
fresh," Leigh pushes the story in a more interesting direction, asking whether people find happiness or simply will it on themselves."
fresh," Director Stephen Soderbergh and its star Matt Damon have crafted a skittish caper movie, a pyrotechnical display of colourful lies that unravel to a giddy retro score."
rotten," Ostensibly celebrating female friendship, it's only fitfully funny."
rotten, An undercover endeavor that never feels as if much is actually being uncovered.
fresh," Fast-paced, inventive animated comic adventure of a Stone Age family gets an extra boost from the lively vocal performances of stars Nicolas Cage, Emma Stone and Ryan Reynolds."
fresh," It's a cozy film with fun characters, fine dialogue and an inspiringly warm and fuzzy theme."
fresh," Oh, look--a good movie."
rotten," Noisy, manic and not much fun at all."
fresh," It is a carefully and beautifully crafted work that appears to be about one thing (the strong bonds of family life), but is really about something else-the way a city forces us to invent our lives."
rotten," Some of the ideas of Bikes vs. Cars have merit, but many... have a noticeable whiff of able-ism, and the film pays only minor lip service to people for whom biking everywhere always is not an option."
rotten," Is there anything less relatable than rich, successful white people whining about how hard they have it?"
fresh," a moving portrait of how the little man, no matter how confident in himself, is usually at the mercy of others with more money and more power and less scruples"
fresh," ...doesn't have the emotional involvement of the best of sci-fi action films, but it's a thrashing good big dipper ride and the 3D actually works"
rotten," By no means terrible or unbearable, though it's slightly disappointing after the brilliance of Kasdan's previous movie."
rotten," For a film by a photographer, it's awfully unfocused."
fresh, A souffle of a comedy.
fresh," How bracing today to have a film that's at once fun, patient, romantic, and real."
rotten," Attempting to embellish the Spice Girls with the lightly fantastical-cum-satirical Beatles-movie vibe, Bob Spiers manages only to lamely reiterate that the only phenomena hereabouts is one of packaging."
rotten, Inferno is an entirely illogical thriller filled with historical babble and endless chases. The third time is certainly not the charm for Director Ron Howard and Tom Hanks.
rotten," It's all too much and not enough-a succession of disparate, can-you-top-this episodes inelegantly piling up like skidding cars on a freeway."
rotten, It only works up much feeling when it is trying to defend itself against protests that might affect its bottom line. You won't be much moved by that either.
fresh," Like most of Kaufman's work as a writer, Synecdoche, New York is a head trip that time and again returns to a place of real human emotion."
rotten, It's C-minus work from people who normally deliver A-level efforts.
fresh," Brilliantly written, animated and performed, it not only bridges the child-adult divide, but also makes its kid-friendly humor smart in its own way."
fresh," As much joy as it would give me to praise Kingdom of the Crystal Skull unreservedly, there are some noticeable defects."
rotten," While the film's informational value is almost non-existent, its emotional knobs are turned up to the max."
rotten, The film is let down by an overlong running time and a prurient attempt to crowbar an emotional response from the taciturn Williams.
rotten, It's a bit like finding a severed head in an Easter basket.
rotten, Confusing thriller is absolutely NOT for kids.
rotten, The most shocking thing about Cannibal Ferox is that it remains a somewhat popular entry in the largely worthless Italian cannibal genre.
fresh," You could find its entrancements stalking you for good, in every meaning of that phrase."
rotten," The right ingredients for a timely political thriller are here-good cast, relevant concept-but Gavin Hood proves the wrong helmer, lacking the requisite perspective and skills to unify the Syriana and Crash-like saga into a coherent and poignant film."
fresh," As a story of the founding of the mutant academy, First Class delivers on the double meaning of its title, twice."
rotten, The movie falls victim to the usual biopic malaise: It doesn't have anything interesting to say about a life that was far from ordinary. 
rotten," Have the Farrellys lost their touch? Once adept at crafting trashy, lowbrow gags way too funny to be ignored, they seem totally tin-eared with 'Hall Pass.'"
fresh, Both very funny and very flawed.
rotten, A movie that keeps jumping the gate and finally unravels all over the floor.
fresh," While not on a par with ""Night of the Living Dead,"" ""The Crazies"" hits the zombie on the head with good reason."
rotten, A largely forgettable film.
fresh," The film's no great shakes, but Russell's star power in ""The Christmas Chronicles"" is a gift anyone should be happy to claim."
fresh," There are a few spots of humour and one decent chase scene, but The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is essentially a nicely costumed bland-out from one of the most overrated directors of our time."
rotten, Make a list of every police movie cliche and you will find them all here.
rotten," Not even the threat of universal annihilation, it seems, will keep this assembly line from chugging ahead with its signature polished, mechanized efficiency."
rotten," In those sequences when Armstrong is heading for the stars, the approach is so immersive on a sensory level -- cacophonous sound design, juddering cinematography verging on the abstract -- that it almost compensates for the void at the film's core."
fresh, The epitome of 80s comedies and source of many a pop culture tagline.
rotten," I don't know what's worse, if paying the movie ticket or losing an hour and a half that nobody is giving me back. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten, Silly fare with the bizarre humor evoking more giggles than guffaws.
rotten, From any angle this is a very ill-considered project -- an obvious contender for worst film of the year.
rotten, The Expendables 3 is like a joke that's been told too many times to still be funny.
fresh," A brutal, blood-soaked film that feels like a primal scream."
rotten," Jurassic World is not like having your eye poked out with a stick. It is loaded to the gills with Stuff. But the summer analogy is San Andreas, not Max Max: Fury Road."
rotten," Jude Law is great, sure, but Dom Hemingway remains a character in search of a story, uttering sentences in search of a script."
rotten," Although Yerzhanov tries something new by gussying up the narrative with allusions to French New Wave amour fou and gangster noir, ""Gentle Indifference"" still feels like a slight knock off of his earlier work."
fresh," What Theroux's film really drives home is the performative nature of the church; everyone is acting, following a script, and only Miscavige knows the ending."
rotten, Rob Zombie's lousy remake of John Carpenter's 1978 slasher classic Halloween adds to the argument that horror movies are losing their box-office appeal because filmmakers no longer know how -- or have any desire -- to create genuine suspense.
rotten," While the ensemble player who gained notice in Guy Ritchie's Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch has the bod, he's unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle."
fresh," A smartly scarifying drama-thriller whose characters are bled of their self-assurance, drop by drop, and so, in a voyeuristic way, are we."
rotten," The concept is inherently funny, but the plot grows thin and the laughs grow fewer once the premise is established."
rotten," Compared to the wisdom and wickedness of High Fidelity, [Boys and Girls] is such a slight movie."
fresh," It's just enough of a change of pace for Rohit Shetty to seem like a radical step forward without being so much of one as to be unrecognizable, as it's still funny and exciting, and the visuals pop."
fresh, This movie is very smart about when it unpacks its interviews versus its recreations. It does it in such a way that I was emotionally flooded. 
fresh," This film is a triumph of art direction and acting, with Moore, Quaid and Haysbert giving performances that feel authentic to the time even as they explore subjects and feelings that were at best implied in movies of that period."
fresh," Doesn't live up to its billing, but is an enjoyable movie that rings in your ears"
fresh," A hyper-violent, hyper-gory, kung-fu grindhouse flick. And there's nothing at all wrong with that."
rotten," [A] lousy, ugly-looking, intensely illogical movie."
rotten," Although [the] sequel doesn't reach the bar set by its predecessor, it comes close at times."
fresh," There may be few surprises as to where this latest one is headed, but Veber socks it over with casting, pacing and subtext."
rotten," [Russell] is great at making the audience like his lovable underdogs; when he tries to lionise them, the effort feels insincere."
fresh," The people in the movie are keeping secrets from each other, and ""Everybody Knows"" is keeping secrets from us."
fresh," Wonderful writing generates several layers of humour -- from the innocent joys of childish fun to more complex comedy, but never at anyone's (or any fish's) cruel expense -- as well as an engaging dramatic plot."
rotten," Adapting a masterpiece such as The Road is a thankless task, but the film doesn't work on its own merits."
fresh, An impressive hybrid.
rotten," Smug yet clueless, Legally Blonde is a junk-food movie striving to be nutritious."
rotten, A relationship that tumbles into chaos and a movie that follows suit.
rotten," Loitering With Intent has its humorous moments, but sadly its characters fall into predictable stereotypes."
rotten," It's [Perdita Weeks'] strangely believable performance that saves the film from itself, planting us firmly in its corner, often against our will."
fresh," It gets the butterflies fluttering as Eddie prepares his final Olympic leap on the monstrous 90m ramp, and really, that's the only tricky jump this movie needs to land."
rotten," ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" is one of the worst films to come out of 2012. "
rotten," It's not a terrible film. Unthaug choreographs some decent action and effects sequences and Vikander does her best with limited resources, but the overall question you're left with after two hours is, quite simply, why?"
rotten," When the list of the year's most eminently forgettable films is drawn up at the end of 2013, ""Snitch"" will likely be near the top."
fresh," The Edge of Seventeen is a delight, with Hailee Steinfeld serving as the radiant star at its center."
rotten," Billed as the first action event movie of the year, superhero flick Elektra isn't so eventful. "
fresh," A fine, touching tribute to John Waters' larger-than-life drag diva ..."
fresh," Proves very likable, if a little Sorkin-lite."
rotten, Deception offers a fantasy even big money can't buy -- Wall Street as a cross between a James Bond adventure and a Victoria's Secret spread.
fresh, [a] vivid and beautifully meditative memory piece on the downtown New York art and music scene of the late 1970s and early '80s...
rotten," The filmmakers are under the mistaken impression that in order for a gag to work, the audience should gag from the gross-out situation."
fresh, You will want to have your tissues ready for the powerful emotional punch delivered by this film. Screenwriters Camp and Thompson break the mold with a story told with sincerity and honesty.
fresh," The result is a genuine sci-fi thinkpiece, challenging and exhilarating."
rotten, Apparently intends to tell a story about people's relationships with movies but winds up saying films are impersonal just because they look professional and don't star YOU.
rotten," There's nothing particularly terrible or poorly constructed about The Equalizer, but its presence in our current cultural landscape renders it innocuous. "
fresh," It's not too cool to use a girlie font in the opening credits, or to let us feel the hero's nerves as he audibly adjusts his leather driving gloves. "
rotten, This listless big-screen blow-up of the Sega video game reduces horror genre conventions to banal clichés.
rotten," It feels slight and heavy-handed at the same time, and ends with a half-hearted shrug."
rotten," No one expects originality, but the new movie may end up making history: It's already looking like the worst movie of the year."
fresh," The best moments of Gunn's follow-up to his 2014 hit have an unfettered filmmaking joy - a knowing, kinetic pleasure that comes with a wink and some adolescent wish fulfilment."
fresh," ""Goon"" easily takes the title of second-best hockey comedy I've ever seen."
rotten," If, like me, you like OutKast just fine but staggered out of Moulin Rouge reeling from the quick-cut-induced nausea, you'll leave Idlewild tapping your toe and scratching your head at the same time."
fresh, It's rare in this day and age when Hollywood puts out something so loony I genuinely have no idea what the hell I just watched. Tag is childish madness that needs to be seen to be believed
rotten," The action is dazzling in terms of overwhelming your senses, but it is rarely awe-inspiring; it doesn't grab you by the throat or rattle your nerves like Spielberg's best work, and it lacks his instinct for feeling."
fresh," The feature evolves from an icy, haunting tale of depression and abandonment into a squalid, sordid, serpentine Alfred Hitchcock pastiche. That it can glide from these two poles with us barely realising is a testament to Soderbergh's talent."
rotten, The main achievement of this joyless mood piece is gutting a Jason Statham potboiler of anything resembling fun.
rotten, SiREN is a strong idea that is somewhat squandered. An example of less would've been more.
fresh," Part music documentary, part mystery, all inspirational homage to unrecognized genius everywhere."
fresh," It all remains on the light-hearted, harmless and inoffensive side despite bad-taste gags and gory Yuletide violence."
rotten, Why does Frankenweenie 2012 feel so incomplete and cobbled together with loose ideas?
fresh," Campbell Scott, Peter Sarsgaard and Patricia Clarkson fill the disconcerting material with measured, subtle performances that bring home what's not being said."
fresh, In its ambitions to say something big and different about the American political scene rises to the occasion to be a fascinating technical achievement ... .
fresh, Let me cut to chase. Ransom really delivers the goods.
fresh," Working with perceptive writer David Magee (Finding Neverand), Ang Lee creates one of the most thoughtful, artistic blockbusters ever made by a Hollywood studio. "
rotten," A random, tedious and tone-deaf comedy, a feeble recycling of every hippie commune cliche you've ever heard."
rotten, These characters exist in a bubble of happy-go-lucky romance and inevitable tragedy.
fresh, This is how you portray adolescence onscreen.
fresh, A backwards detective story with Kane's lost childhood as an elusive puzzle piece in a lifetime of megalomania.
rotten, One to watch when there's no decent comedy left on Netflix.
rotten," The filmmakers seem to have forgotten that even today, the most memorable battles have two fronts. And they usually don't involve a man wearing a woman's underwear."
rotten," I couldn't spoil the plot if I wanted to, since I have no idea how it all ties together."
rotten, There are poop jokes and c*m shots but nothing as insightfully twisted as the diarrhea twins.
fresh," Cassel's subtle and quietly menacing performance helps compensate for a story that drifts along rather aimlessly at times, while Kleiman's dreamy visuals mark him out as a talent to watch."
fresh," [O]ne of Pixar's all-time greats, a marvelous achievement worth experiencing with your whole family."
fresh," A coming-of-age story exploring one's first experience with true love and sexual uncertainty, including the hypnotic pleasures of both physical and intellectual affection balanced against bittersweet heartbreak"
fresh," A grisly, Maori revenge flick tailor-made for fans of high body-count fare."
fresh," From their very first feature, the Coen Brothers already had their brilliance firmly in place. "
fresh," ...the story here is Bridges and the title of that story is ""Brilliant!"""
rotten, Moviegoers probably won't be interested in seeing Mel Gibson in an onscreen train wreck that reminds them so much of the mess he's made of his real life.
rotten," Nacho Libre is more lazy than offensive. Things happen, but there's really no story. People do stuff, but they don't become characters. It might have made a dandy Saturday Night Live skit. But it's not much of a movie."
fresh, Snow Angels is such a fascinating smorgasbord of flawed behavior that it exerts the voyeuristic pull of a first-rate small-town soap opera.
rotten," Disastrously directed by Jane Campion, it is a DOA thriller that, when it should be boiling, can't even warm up to a slow simmer."
rotten," Devoid of anything resembling wit or even guiltily amusing tasteless gags, the film lurches from one haplessly staged sequence to another, with the performers vainly struggling to infuse humor into the proceedings."
fresh," Despite the shrieking Valkyries on the soundtrack, Évocateur is as fair a portrayal as the weak-chinned warrior will get -- and fairer than he deserves."
rotten, [Clint] Eastwood lacks subtlety. [Full Review in Spanish] 
fresh, Melville's impressionistic look at the Resistance is without a doubt the best war film I never knew existed.
fresh, Works because the dialogue is insightful and meaningful.
fresh," It's like Harry Potter meets Full Metal Jacket, and while that's certainly an intriguing mash-up, the movie doesn't quite live up to the book's reputation."
rotten, A shockingly mean-spirited effort that picks all the wrong targets and doesn't garner many laughs.
rotten," But more than anything yet seen in Moore's career, this film was made in the bubble and breathes truly rarified air."
rotten, Few pictures in recent memory have worked as laboriously as Lasse Hallstrom's new romantic farce to be a featherweight lark.
fresh," With his film Mendes not only resurrects 007, but makes the character's defining trademarks make more sense in a modern world"
fresh, The great thing about the film is that it refuses to cave in and make Napoleon a hero.
rotten," Malick comes out with a movie about once every ten years, but I think I've had about enough. You can keep him."
fresh, One of the best animated movies of the past couple of years and the most enjoyable family entertainment of recent months.
rotten," Instead of entertaining us, director Robert Redford offers us a handsome history lesson that's as dry as a hardtack biscuit."
rotten," Set It Up is an example of what not to do - do not cast the charismatic, fabulously dressed Lucy Liu if you do not have a movie worthy of her talents."
rotten," The 11th Hour is slick and passionate, but neither persuasive nor helpful; it's a headache of a film directed like an Errol Morris project, but with half the substance. It's clearly preaching to the choir, but even they may find it off-key."
fresh, Harrowing portrait of brave role model has mature themes. 
fresh," It is possibly the best-known erotic film of modern times, perhaps the best."
rotten," The movie is undermined by wobbly plotting, unconvincing casting and a script that veers into unintentional camp about an hour in and never finds its way back."
rotten," So much sameness, yet so fewer laughs."
rotten, [S]tumbles at every turn.
rotten," If the accepted wisdom is that chronically single people don't know what they want, the film will stay alone for life."
rotten," Since the Minions themselves are barely characters, much of the film falls on the shoulders of Bullock. She isn't up to the challenge."
fresh," James Marsh's gripping thriller set in Northern Ireland demands patience and concentration of its audience, but the impeccably crafted film is well worth the effort."
rotten," That's the biggest problem with this Jungle Book. Sommers is so busy spinning his camera, crowding the soundtrack with animal noises and piling on the cheesy visual effects that he can't stop for a reflective moment or a character-revealing touch."
rotten, San Crash (2005) grammeno ap' to tmima peri metanaston toy amerikanikoy Ypoyrgeioy Eksoterikon
fresh," We've seen much of what goes down in Mean Creek before. But I can't say I've ever seen it portrayed with such high standards of responsibility to the way kids really act, think and judge."
fresh," The performances of Caine, Arkin and Freeman actually feel wonderfully understated. They give these characters life and make their stories tremendously relatable."
rotten," I do not recommend that you spend to see Skyscraper: Rescue in the heights, the same and someday it finishes in Netflix and it will have found that it is its true place in the universe. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten, Those who will learn something from it can have no interest whatsoever in The Doors. This leaves its intended audience somewhat unclear.
fresh," Like show-business culture itself, A Chorus Line traffics in both cloying sentimentality and Darwinian ruthlessness, qualities that James D. Stern and Adam Del Deo's highly addictive behind-the-scenes documentary Every Little Step captures in abundance."
fresh, Director Olivier Assayas is one step ahead of the audience the whole time.
rotten," If only the potential audience for this one could be bothered to Netflix ""The Blair Witch Project"" this reboot could have been avoided. Actually, it still should be."
fresh, Director-star Aktan Arym Kubat has come up with an illuminating parable about the clash of tradition and modernity...
fresh," With a rich sense of lived experience, Potter first portrays the blithe excitement and sense of joyful conspiracy shared by the two friends. "
rotten," Conseil personnel, allez donc revoir le premier volet."
rotten, Bentley doesn't have what it takes to be creepy and scary. He's too pretty. I have a feeling most women in the audience would be quite happy if he tied them up
fresh," Logan Lucky is like those inline tube slides at a water park: you don't worry about where you're going, because getting there is so much darned fun."
rotten," Despite one of the year's best trailers, this horror-film spoof is as laugh-challenged as the woeful first sequel."
fresh," Despite a crippling lack of solid information and a fair amount of speculation, the documentary mounts a solid case for Le Prince, an inventor and artist, to be recognised as the true father of film."
fresh, A damning indictment of the individuals and institutions who made money while customers lost their shirts.
rotten," The meandering verbal games in Le Jour Se Lève come across too much as ornate screenwriting, as if a piece of high-classical theatre has been shoe-horned into the grot-flecked alleys and boarding houses of provincial France."
fresh," Shorter than a bad blind date and as sour as a vinegar Popsicle, ""Young Adult"" shrouds its brilliant, brave and breathtakingly cynical heart in the superficial blandness of commercial comedy."
rotten, Disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies...or any other John Woo flick for that matter.
rotten," The ugly truth of The Ugly Truth is that it is, yet again, another in a long line of recent Hollywood romantic comedies that for some reason hates women."
rotten, ... they can't make a silk purse out of the sow's ear that is this formulaic bachelor party/bucket list buddy comedy.
rotten, Anything can happen -- anything except anything remotely entertaining.
rotten," ""A Fantastic Woman"" can at times seem too invested in defining Marina not by what she does but by what is done to her. "
rotten," It's a film so terrifically inept, on so many levels of direction, performance and intent, that it demands and receives its audience's full, stunned attention."
rotten," Director Nora Ephron takes an imaginative idea and turns it into a flat, skill-less dud."
rotten, Underworld is one of the most visually stunning motion pictures of the year. Everything else...is ready for the scriptwriter's junkyard.

fresh, ... feels like a major step in the right direction for the Farrellys
rotten," Tinker Bell and Peter Pan go through their pixie dust-powered motions throughout the film, but nothing ever soars."
fresh," Stirring, soulful, and incendiary. "
fresh," The Messenger involves difficult subject matter, but it's not hard to watch. It's sad and sobering, but also humorous and touching at turns."
rotten," Me Before You might have been a profound movie, but it instead goes for an easy marketing niche, copying a template that has previously proven successful with female moviegoers of a certain age range."
rotten, Ritchie has packed Revolver with so much 'substance' that it completely overwhelms his still somewhat charming style.
fresh, Carrie has proved itself to be a remarkably resilient tale that's not likely to be plugged up anytime soon.
fresh, A good old-fashioned bad action movie; the type the eighties used to churn out on a regular basis. 
rotten, Hollywood has taken quite a nosedive from Alfred Hitchcock's imaginative flight to Shyamalan's self-important summer fluff.
rotten," An interesting, but not entirely entertaining film."
rotten," There is still activity, I regret to report, and none of it is of the normal variety."
fresh, It's as much a funeral procession for a dying art as it is a celebration of its ideals.
fresh," Will it light the world on fire like Wonder Woman? No, but Tomb Raider is another step in the right direction of female empowerment finding representation in cinema."
fresh, We were always building monuments to our power and we always will be--performance is just one avenue to that same old immortality.
rotten," We never see a single moment of strife within the Cavendish home, the family and their circle's upper lips so stiff they could serve tea on them."
fresh," The movie humanizes King, in occasionally startling ways."
rotten, A rattling sound design and the cinematographer Laurie Rose's excellent use of low light aren't enough to make the experience immediate.
fresh, The Avengers lives up to every last ounce of hype.
fresh," Proves an action movie can have it all: smart without being convoluted, flashy without being shallow, fun without being hollow, and exciting without being dumb."
fresh, The Return of the King totally rules.
rotten," A stilted romance, an attempt at diversity and honesty that ends up phony and conventional."
rotten," The Master of Disguise may have made a great Saturday Night Live sketch, but a great movie it is not."
rotten," The performances are pretty good, Cox especially, but all in all we don't really care all that much about the characters or what happens to them, and the ending, while unexpected is really lame."
fresh," With new writers and directors, this frenetic sequel indulges in silliness with less substance than last time. "
fresh, Robbins' understated depression and Lawrence' hyperactive ranting are the perfectly hilarious foil for one another.
fresh," The decision to let Brosnan play Osnard probably kept the Bond producers up a few nights, but letting him do it was the right call."
rotten, [T]he entire thing [is] almost saved by a quartet of performances that are much better than the material they serve. 
rotten," [Wallace] can write a good fight (Braveheart), but he certainly can't shoot one."
fresh," Arrietty is a fresh take on Mary Norton's classic The Borrowers, with animated artwork that will have adults enchanted and children gripped."
fresh," Highlighted by sparkling performances by Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana, this is touching, romantic and intriguing, up with the best of the time-warpers."
rotten," There's a flatness about the whole enterprise -- like drinking champagne, but from an old house slipper."
fresh," Forges a pretty bulletproof family film from what from what I, at least, feared would be a worn-out formula."
rotten," ...just as sloppily caffeinated as before, with an extra layer of scummy race jokes."
fresh, This is a true story of human endurance but also a poignant tale of a woman desperately seeking to conquer her demons and cleanse her spirit.
rotten, The wholesome child-friendly lessons made me feel queasy.
rotten," Like Marshall's last ensemble piece, Valentine's Day, New Year's Eve is strictly by the numbers, a generic exercise in empty momentum."
fresh," The story is a good one, but it's the two lead performances that make the film work."
rotten," Superficially slick, yet schlocky, a muddled misadventure..."
fresh," A Tantalus glimpse of what America might have been with a president who cared about the planet, its people and its peace."
rotten," Chow's loyal fans are sure to be disappointed by CJ7, and the film faces one other significant problem in traveling to these shores: Any kid who is the right age to appreciate this pap is going to be too young to read subtitles."
rotten," It's a wonder the actors aren't showing bruise marks from all the heavy-handed direction, the unrelenting solemnity of the thing."
fresh," So fascinating, you may not notice how much time has passed when the credits finally roll."
rotten," It is all competent, but it never becomes as engrossing as such a compelling story would suggest. "
fresh," Regardless, this time with Avengers: Age of Ultron, our socks were only tugged on, halfway flopping off our collective toes, but never blown quite off."
fresh," Duncan Jones' twisty sci-fi gem knows how to build a mystery, how to parcel out clues, and how to keep an audience guessing until the end. "
fresh, anybody who wants to experience cinema at its most cinematic and grand should rush and experience it for themselves. It is a truly stunning motion picture and one that ranks as the best film 2010 has so far offered.
fresh," Even as the questions build, the story and the images on the screen cast their own spell such that one is willing to put aside one's puzzlement."
rotten," Poorly conceived and executed, it doesn't even feel like something that can be laughed about when it shows up on cable... which will probably be very soon."
fresh, That there are any ideas here to begin with marks enough of a victory for commercial filmmaking.
fresh," A Man Called Ove deftly incorporates the seminal moments of its titular character's past in a series of flashbacks that inform, rather than intrude upon, the present."
rotten," The plot is ponderous and overloaded, with a running time pushing a not-very-kid-friendly two hours."
fresh, 'It's better to choose your own family.'
fresh," None of it is particularly bloody or violent, but young Wan and twin screenwriters Chad and Carey Hayes, up to now mostly unheralded in the horror genre, fashion a harrowing montage of thrills from beginning to end."
fresh," Scarier, funnier and more entertaining than it has a right to be."
rotten," This is a pretty clichéd affair, although it's an effective sweaty palm experience."
fresh," It's hard not to watch Fruitvale Station with a coiled dread... Yet, Coogler's greatest achievement may be in reminding us that Grant was a work in progress with people who loved him in spite of his flaws and because of his hopes."
fresh," There is real heart beneath the movie's thick shellacking of lost man-child sensitivity, and generally terrific acting that makes matters credible."
fresh," One of recent memory's most thoughtful films about art, ethics, and the cost of moral compromise."
fresh," Demonios!, Y yo que estaba tan bien en mi soltera!"
fresh," In Her, Jonze transforms his music-video aesthetic into something magically personal."
fresh, There are several ways to look at these scenes. But all you really have to do is listen.
fresh," Because United prefers human and industry conflict over playing field disputes, it makes the film an accessible and spellbinding showcase for tightly-suited antagonism and venomous verbal spray. This is a first-rate drama."
rotten, Hugh Jackman's big top musical isn't the disaster you've heard it is...but it also isn't good.
rotten," Owen's performance as a man who values his own faux-sophistication even as he goes to seed overpowers Binoche, leaving the movie lopsided."
rotten," The humour is sometimes used to hide the pain, while at other times the drama takes precedence and asks us to switch modes. This ambivalent approach is also evident in the differing styles of performance"
rotten," a bewilderingly awful concoction that seems to have been written by a committee whose individual members were forbidden to contact one another and who seem to be ignorant of the most rudimentary fundamentals of storytelling, screenwriting or coherence"
fresh," Very funny, extremely obscene."
fresh, [An] infectiously upbeat bigscreen extension of Disney Channel's runaway TV movie sensation.
rotten," For the second half of the film, it's all chase and chase and chase some more, with little audience involvement in how it turns out."
rotten, Julie & Julia is two movies in one. That's one more movie than it needs to be.
fresh, Ken Loach's heartrending drama follows a widowed British carpenter struggling to keep an inhuman social services bureaucracy from turning him into just another number.
rotten, Self-aware but self-regarding indie navel gazing; no cause for celebration.
fresh," The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 could easily have been rolled together with Part 1, but it hasn't turned out too poorly."
rotten, Offbeat drama about modern babymaking turns dark and bloody.
fresh," The Martian is its own unique and wonderful beast, with a bizarre (in the best possible way) tone that is full of fun and wonder. It's a feel-good romp with lashings of science, a sci-fi flick with laughs, an ensemble comedy, a crowd-pleasing blockbuster."
fresh, Enjoyable nonsense.
fresh," Farhadi must have directed his cast in a language and a country he does not know, so could that be why none of it quite rings true?"
rotten, ...So caught up in its own art it rarely succeeds at being truly scary.
rotten," Sickening and utterly pointless, when it's not just outrageously tweaked for shock value, the film is soulless and caters to the darkest of human instincts."
rotten, Here's a perfect example of bad timing: The release of 'New in Town.'
rotten," Everything in this movie, written by Aline Brosh McKenna and directed by Roger Michell, seems way off."
fresh," A timely reminder of how a child's education is crucially connected to their teacher, this French drama turns a primary school classroom into a kinetic learning space where the one adult nurtures, encourages and above all believes "
fresh," ...a movie scrubbed of subtlety, but it's not an ineffective or boring work, it's actually highly suspenseful - at times ridiculously tense."
fresh, KHNH drips with color and cheer.
rotten," It's all a shell of itself, with Fred Savage on hand to occasionally note how weird this all is."
rotten," Some movies are phonier than others. ""Widows"" is one of those. The always thin line between a twisty plot and a silly one gets crossed about an hour in."
fresh, A moving dramatic comedy that portrays the loyalty in brotherhood with emotional grit and tenderness.
rotten, Welcome to the bottom of the barrel. Population: this movie.
fresh," It takes time for ""The Hallow"" to get rolling, but once it reaches a bang-up final act, genre fans could walk out clamoring for a sequel."
fresh, Impressive and pretty amazing. This is how you make a film.
fresh," Bertolucci's best work to date. Film, politics, sex, the cultural divide, love, relationships, parenting - are looked over by his camera, and the result is breathtaking."
rotten," From the get-go, Last Days on Mars looks like a film which the parties involved put about half their effort and care into."
fresh," Those happy to embrace the silliness can expect a steady supply of pulpy, B-movie fun coupled with moments of effectively nasty blood-and-guts body horror."
fresh," It has been so long since Firth applied his undoubted talent to a film that truly warranted it, and he rises to the challenge in impressive fashion."
rotten," Calling Dumb And Dumber To a comedy is a monumental stretch, because I typically laugh during comedies."
fresh," Gentle, poetic, touching."
rotten," The moral decay of movies as evidenced by increased and wholly gratuitous violence against children finds a logical, sorry bottom in Pride and Glory."
fresh," Marvel continues to remind us that being an ethical, self-realized human is more important than being a superhuman."
rotten, The film coasts on nostalgia. It needs to swing that hatchet harder to make a mark of its own.
fresh," It's Mishima's diagrammatic structure that most perfectly suits its subject, defined by his will to harmony."
fresh," The quartet of musicians, led by the pianist and composer Freddie Redd and the caustic-toned post-bop saxophonist Jackie McLean, perform brilliantly on-camera as they dramatize both the agonized wait and the needed high."
rotten," Grisly, gory, over-the-top action-parody isn't for kids."
fresh," To say that The Island is Michael Bay's best movie to date is more than a backhanded compliment, particularly for discriminating moviegoers"
rotten," It's a giant universe out there, but in these movies it just keeps getting smaller."
rotten," Not much going on with this one. It was part Scarface, part New Jack City and part Sugarhill. If you've- seen these, you've seen Empire."
fresh, Martin and Caine scam women. Not for young kids.
fresh," A movie that offers up an interesting now vs. then comparison, placing today's troubles in the light of past struggles, but also grows repetitive in its systematic juxtaposition of old and new."
fresh," A refreshing celebration of the non-toxic variety of masculinity, Magic Mike XXL hits every mark that it aims for. This is the America the world dreams about."
rotten," Sexual violence, cursing in strongly pro-vigilante drama."
fresh, The student-teacher dynamic here is intriguing -- and not in the obvious way.
fresh," For this critic, Nolan hits shy of the mark for cinematic brilliance but still manages to land a visually stunning entertainment in its own right. "
fresh," A movie this well observed, this drenched in naturalism, this candid and poignant, can only spring from reality."
rotten, Marmaduke is a dog of a film that deserves to be put down.
rotten," Wild Hogs is more tired, worn out, and sagging than its protagonists -- an arthritic comedy whose humor is below mediocre and whose drama is cringe-worthy."
fresh," HAYWIRE is a pared-down, almost simplistic action movie, mostly designed to showcase the beauty and power of Soderbergh's new star, female mixed martial arts fighter Carano."
fresh," But for all its flaws and unevenness, The Dunning Man isn't without its charms."
fresh," Sauper's delicately horrific documentary is a short, sharp slap in the face of the developed world, and a long overdue one at that."
fresh," At one point, I did roll my eyes and think that the movie might be going too far. But then I realized they had been going too far for years. That's what makes them still edgy."
rotten, This incoherent screenplay seems to have been written by a roomful of the gorilla-like trolls who show up in the movie at one point.
rotten," With her broad, thinker's forehead, imp's crooked grin and large, deer-in-the-headlights eyes, Morton at first suggests hidden depths within Morvern. But as the film plays on, the character comes off as increasingly shallow and dull."
rotten, I sometimes felt more like I was watching the pilot episode of a 1980s TV show -- a cheap action-adventure series in which the cheerful kung-fu teacher Bruce Lee would come to the aid of someone pestered by bad guys.
rotten," This is an exceedingly well directed, cleverly filmed and edited, tension-filled affair. It is also a wholly preposterous, muddled, paranoid view of the inner-city nightmare where the slightest misstep is sure to have a fateful result."
rotten, Central Intelligence is a film that feels low on ideas. 
rotten," One's interest is diminished as the dramatic focus becomes unclear, petering out in well-meaning rhetorical confusion."
fresh," It's an unsettling picture, but also engrossing and emotive, handling expectation for gloom and doom with inspired dramatic depth and performances. "
fresh," The movie is tellingly named after the blunt, informal term for the ritual (hara-kiri means ""cut belly"") and effectively deglorifies these ""honorable"" ritual suicides."
fresh," Con man meets the mob. Violent, grown-up tale."
fresh," Mr. Jackson not only improves on the original, he somehow seems to create the film that King Kong was always meant to be."
fresh, The film succeeds largely by doing its own thing.
fresh, A tense and exciting action-drama about a young British soldier caught out of his depth on the mean streets of Belfast in Northern Ireland in the early years of the Troubles.
fresh," an old-school, red-blooded action vehicle with a little bit of sentimentality mixed in for good measure"
rotten," If I could review the film in halves, I'd give the comedy act *** and the drama *."
fresh, I never realized what an astoundingly beautiful film it was.
fresh," ""The Fits"" is the kind of film that asks more questions than it answers. The questions have echoing resonance."
fresh, Knights! Castles! Broadswords! Catapults! Flaming balls! Severed heads! Burning oil! Gushing digital blood!
rotten," Sure, Emily utters the occasional spiky Schumerism, but most scenes feel designed and stretched for improv when no one appears to be improvising."
fresh," Micmacs may not be everyone's cup of capricious comedy, but it delivers an audio-visual picnic of surprises that makes craziness contagious."
fresh," This installment clocks in as the shortest Harry Potter film yet, but it sacrifices little in terms of thrills and tears, and has some seriously cool special effects."
rotten," Noyce is a gifted director with a track record of engaging films, but the very emotions stolen from his characters -- excitement, fear, passion and joy -- are equally missing from his movie."
fresh," With empathetic reserve only sullied by occasional lapses into cross-cutting and musical italicizing, The Way We Get By equates the sadness of war and aging."
fresh," Super Dark Times is that special kind of film that we as genre fans are always desperate to discover, the one that we fall in love with and show to all of our friends. It's essentially a new classic that will stand the test of time."
fresh, The film comes close to collapsing into exploitation or self-parody. Thank Sidibe's extraordinary performance that it doesn't.
rotten, Not even the elaborate stunt sequences offer much suspense because it all feels contrived and computer-generated.
rotten, Always manage[s] to spoil the fun with elaboration.
rotten," What the film is saying, so far as I can tell, is that, if cut, you will bleed. And bleed."
rotten," ...Endless Love is silly and trumped up, though it may do something for tween girls dreaming over Pettyfer."
fresh," While in no way softening the all-encompassing propaganda state of three generations of Great Leader Kims, Songs from the North also displays a rare audacity by showing certain aspects of North Korean life as perfectly normal. "
fresh, Peter Strickland follows up his chilly giallo-horror Berberian Sound Studio with something altogether warmer and sweeter - though no less strange.
rotten, Dedicated cinephiles who feel an obligation to see what von Trier has wrought are unlikely to reach consensus on whether he is an exploitative provocateur or crusading pamphleteer.
fresh, Familiar but moving.
rotten," Bad Words is clearly jockeying to be another Bad Santa, but because it frequently pulls back from going too far, it lacks that picture's killer instinct."
fresh," [Mission: Impossible - Fallout] once again relies on coherent, well-executed action set pieces, a few moments of winking dialogue and Cruise's complete willingness to hurl himself headlong into harm's way if it might allow him to win our love."
fresh," ... it is a generous, warm and emotionally intelligent portrayal of female friendship across ages."
rotten," The film bounces from knockaround black comedy to gruesome action film to not-quite-clever-enough sci-fi mindbender, without ever establishing a consistent tone or a style that works."
fresh," This is as plain-faced a film about slavery could possibly be, and the effect of its evenness is, oddly enough, more emotion."
rotten," Colbert is too good, and the script (though bloated) too full of lovely details about small town American life in the '40s to reject it outright."
fresh," Always sees its location and subjects for the complex place and people they are, and not the external labels ascribed to them."
rotten," A little bit of Into the Night is funny, a lot of it is grotesque and all of it has the insidey manner of a movie made not for the rest of us but for moviemakers on the Bel Air circuit who watch each other's films in their own screening rooms."
fresh, With moviegoers facing a grim season of pallid CGI battle-toons ... even the problematic adventures of one Indiana Jones can feel like a rich banquet in comparison.
rotten, Weird-stupid more than good-stupid ...
rotten," Disney-schmaltz, family-values hokum, and dopey clichés ('anything's possible,' 'different's OK,' etc.), syrup over the intriguing allegory. If only the movie had plunged deeper into its well of meaning and stopped jerking at our heartstrings."
rotten, Exactly as middlebrow and mainstream as most of Howard's oeuvre..Chatter about it as an Oscar contender is simply laughable. 
rotten," Giving 007 a sleek bullet of a BMW instead of his trusty old Aston-Martin isn't exactly going to turn the world of Bond upside down. And, as it turns out, neither does the casting of Brosnan."
rotten," At times, ""Hot Rod"" seems to park itself on the viewer's head and refuse to budge until it gets a laugh. And it does, sometimes."
rotten," It has noble intentions, but seems aimed more at subscribers than viewers; it's never a good sign when a movie's most visually and dramatically compelling moment is a three-minute clip from The Dick Cavett Show."
rotten, Anyone who reads advice books about romance has one problem to begin with: bad taste in literature.
rotten, The film's approach could be interesting if it weren't because it tries to tackle too many things in more than two and a half hours of footage without them fit at all. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten, Yes! We can take everything that is intriguingly dark and almost sinister about crying-on-the-inside clown Jim Carrey and make it light! and upbeat! and unambiguous!
fresh," If you love classic movies and their potential to sweep you up into a world outside of your own experience, this one will rock your world."
rotten," Here the devil does not speak, the market speaks. And there is nothing wrong with that: the problem is that there is nothing really disturbing, potentially luciferian. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten, A lousy excuse for a big-budget action film. 
rotten, The type of film that must have been made for 8-year-olds.
rotten," There are a few tricks and tropes that aren't quite what you're expecting into the final act here, but in order to get to them you need to trudge through oodles of potty-mouthed he-man nonsense and characters who you'd cross the street to avoid."
rotten, This game is so over.
rotten," After a while this starts to feel like dithering, or the machinations of soap opera."
rotten," A fun, if messy, compilation of the most absurd action scenes ever put on celluloid."
fresh," This sort of lush, period romance doesn't come around much anymore."
rotten," Roger Michell's brightly lit film turns America's 32nd president from world statesman into naughty codger, quite the fall from grace for the man who led his country through the Great Depression and the Second World War."
fresh, Heartfelt (if bland) football biopic is great for game fans.
rotten," missing, unfortunately, both laughs and tears"
rotten," The fight scenes are saggy, the actors are stiff, and the sleepiness of it all is enough to make you nostalgic for the simple smackdown charms of the movie's namesake videogame."
rotten," Trying to become the next ""Twilight,"" it is a better film in most respects than any entry in that franchise - although that's damning it with faint praise."
fresh, Crowe shows great skill in staging scenes. He finds the right pacing to get the most out of the scenes without letting them become contrived.
rotten, Showgirls for guys. Kind of lame.
fresh," With her crooked smile, throaty voice, and wise guy eyes, Emma Stone is a superstar in waiting"
fresh," Not much has changed in Sin City, but if you enjoyed your last visit more of the same should be more than enough."
fresh," You'll have to check your brain at the door, but as long as you remember to pick it up on the way out, you should be fine. "
fresh," Superbly made, frequently funny and surprisingly moving, Guy Maddin's weird and wonderful semi-documentary is a genuine treat."
fresh," Without slipping into mushy sentimental overtures, the movie has something real and immediate to say about the power of compassion."
fresh," Paul W.S. Anderson may have a lot of flaws as a filmmaker, but the man knows cheap thrills, and he delivers them here."
rotten," Not as heinous and mushy as dudes fear, and not as romantic and dreamy as the ladies might be hoping."
fresh," As a whole, Happy Christmas is a lighthearted film whose existence will be recognized by fans of Swanberg, but most likely overlooked by the rest."
fresh, Falling on the right side of the line that divides the warmth of everyday history from the easy comfort of nostalgia.
fresh, A charming feel-good fantasy of 'Marxist' solidarity resurgent against the chill of post-9/11 modernity.
fresh," Stephen Frears' direction is superb -- the design and lighting evoke simultaneous worlds of privilege and squalor, and while the nature of day-to-day life in 18th century France becomes readily apparent, it never becomes distracting."
fresh," Though Frost does prove a charming and surprisingly fleet-footed leading man, this lovable loser tale makes some unfortunate missteps. "
rotten, Deserving of ending up in the latter part of its title ...
fresh, See the 2D version if you can and enjoy a commercial film that is certainly good -- but some way short of great.
rotten, Drop Dead Gorgeous is undeniably a refinement of the Farrelly Bros.' brand of audacity.
fresh," What the movie loses in kicky sensationalism, it sometimes gains in psychological nuance."
fresh," To the uninitiated, the subject matter of Startup.com may sound dry or confusing, but this film is anything but."
fresh, A depressing but engrossing Russian blend of a domestic drama and police procedural crime drama
rotten," The film is part romance, part drama, part Seattle travelogue, with Washington emerging as the only true winner. Along with the benefactors of the movie's copious product placements, that is."
rotten," Brit romcom about writer's block has brief nudity, cliches."
rotten," Family films we need. Films like this, we never need."
rotten," Certainly bloody, but not bloody good...doesn't go the tongue-in-cheek route, but by the close it's pretty risible."
fresh," It is impressive, though, the way the movie works to incorporate new online phenomenons, from Bitcoin to swatting. The latter bit, especially, resonates as one of the film's most unsettling elements, if only because it feels so depressingly possible."
fresh," Still, a documentary of this nature lives and dies by the personality of its subject and Carol Channing has plenty to spare."
fresh," What's good about Pelham's example of the form is that the performances are allowed enough leeway so that we care about the people not the plot mechanics. And what could have been formula trash turns out to be fairly classy trash, after all."
fresh," Messy, rich with feeling, liberated from simple theatrical structures, always honest about what is possible."
fresh," Shaun's dry wit, and humor is why it succeeds where most Zombie film's fail. It's the funniest movie of the year."
rotten," Other than Tavernier's odd decision to draw Taillard de Worms with broad strokes, while sketching the remaining ensemble with considerable nuance, The French Minister has one big barrier to audiences who don't speak French: There are too many words."
fresh, Spectre is a film of sequences rather than sustained adventure.
rotten," We're primed for an old-fashioned cat fight, but director Stephan Elliot can't get more fangs from Biel than a kitten."
fresh," The pic's charismatic cast turns the skeletal narrative into something functional, making for a surprisingly pleasant ride."
fresh," Solid, stylish superhero saga that's more fun than 'Thor,' 'Green Hornet' and 'Green Lantern.'"
rotten," 'Beautiful Creatures' is stylish, campy fun at times."
fresh," The film is creepy, and not because of any one particular scene or moment, but because Nolan takes us, body and soul, into a place that all is illuminated all the time"
fresh, It's a fairy tale that comes from a renowned Indian film culture that allows Americans to finally revel in its splendor.
fresh, The effects are outstanding and the rendition of the ape heroes is still a joy to watch.
fresh," It doesn't try too hard, but what ""The Lie"" is working at, in its unassuming, amusing way, is a mini-portrait of growing pains in a time of extended adolescence."
fresh," An intriguing personal take on a man who turns out to be endlessly intriguing, no matter what you think of his antics."
rotten," Their collective trip to hell is death tourism for the viewer; its sole, genuine feeling the one of relief that comes when it's over."
fresh," The film is beautifully shot and there are dreamy sequences that convey, better than anything I've seen or read, the fantastical, creative quality of Darwin's mind."
fresh," Salazar's exquisite attention to detail reveals itself in the visuals as much as the performances, plus the costume design is knock-your-socks-off memorable."
fresh, A wonderful tribute to the life and work of an extraordinary woman.
fresh," If occasionally the movie works too hard to manufacture dramatic points, that's easy enough to forgive in the face of the performances writer-director Damien Chazelle (Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench) draws from his stars."
rotten," The film's uncomplicated plot, undemanding stunt work, unconvincing special effects, and unpolished acting are reminders of its cheesy, simple-minded roots. "
rotten," If Donnie Darko was Kelly's Eraserhead, then maybe Southland Tales is his Dune, an unfortunate folly before a more substantial, velveteen Blue period."
rotten," As a film made expressly to launch its male lead to stardom, it can't be regarded as a full success if it fails to do so."
fresh," ...a watchable, sporadically moving drama..."
rotten, [Gibney] is never quite able to get beyond the familiar in order to give viewers a new and penetrating look at the subject of Thompson and his work.
fresh, If not essential then at least not not essential.
fresh," Reeves and Weisz have chemistry, and they know a little humor goes a long way in a film of this sort."
rotten," There is no psychological insight, no moral insight, just no insight, full stop. And it palls after a while."
rotten," ""Wetlands"" attempts to turn Atlantic City in December into a noir nexus of drug-dealing surfers, struggling moms and broken cops, but instead merely claims a handful of good actors as unfortunate victims."
rotten, Nearly every moment in Dean is derivative of better movies.
rotten," Zero out of five stars for unparalleled, iconic perversity and destroying a legacy."
fresh," All of the trusted movie sites categorize this as a drama, but if that's the case, why did I spend so much of the running time dabbing tears of laughter?"
fresh," Soderbergh... remains a talented filmmaker with an instinctive gift for pacing and style. Cinephiles can rejoice that his self-imposed retirement seems to be over, even if he doesn't push himself too hard in this modest return."
fresh," Clearly, this isn't about crime and it isn't about terror; it isn't even about the heist...it's about being fed up with the quintessential American city."
fresh," The offbeat Big Fan stays poised on the edge of comedy and tragedy, and doesn't tip its hand until, well, the final gun."
rotten," It's shockingly dull for a popcorn flick, and only ardent fans of the comic are likely to enjoy it."
rotten," A last-minute, gimmicky, careless money grab."
fresh," ""We the Animals"" unfolds almost as a dream, albeit one that never shies away from the often hopeless reality of what it's like to grow up poor in America."
rotten," For a movie where people are naked for a large chunk of time and play at bondage and dominance (without ever really seeming all that committed to it), it sure is boring."
fresh," A masterful construction of plot, characters and style."
fresh," Although his latest film, Howl's Moving Castle, features astonishing imagery, it's a less complete package than Spirited Away or its predecessor, Princess Mononoke."
rotten," [Woo] pulls out all the stops to recreate extensive battle scenes with high spectacle impact, but fails to capture the nuance and personal touch of his early action films."
fresh," They seem like a real family, beaver puppet and all. And 'The Beaver' gives them the dignity they deserve in their troubled times. "
fresh," Crazy Rich Asians is one of those movies that both embraces and transcends its genre, in this case rom-coms, to work on multiple levels."
rotten," For all the references to the previous movies and the current Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. show, this is a movie that seems unable to find any justification for its own existence. "
rotten," [A] needlessly odd, unfashionably sentimental drama."
rotten, Ted contains 12-15 minutes of the some of the best comedy I've seen in a movie this year. Now see if you can stand the other 90.
rotten," If you've been wishing and hoping for a movie in which June Squibb - here playing a dementia-riddled relative named Aunt Fishy - shows her underpants yet again, you'll love Love the Coopers. For the rest of us, to know them is to hate them."
rotten, To say that sacred and profane imagery are daringly juxtaposed here would be seriously understating the case.
rotten," True, Ali acts the hell out of his role, but his interpretation of the character is too constrained by the anti-intellectual lens through which we're being forced to view him."
rotten, Michael Levine provides a history without a real sense of individuated struggle or even singular personage.
rotten, This parody from the Coen Brothers is merely easy cynicism.
rotten," Despite the clear emotional and political stakes in the balance, ""Hyde Park"" plays like a diverting anecdote and nothing more."
rotten, A nightmare of a movie.
fresh," It really made me laugh, but for some moments I was tearing up because I could relate so much."
rotten," All the while, it's slowly grabbing a rubber chicken off the table behind it, getting ready to suddenly stick the tired old gag in your face right when it has your attention."
fresh," ""First Reformed"" is the kind of film that will stay with you long after the credits."
rotten," ...confuses comedy with general stupidity, allowing the characters to spout out lines of idiocy as if the effort is enough to warrant laughs."
rotten," With Ghibli announcing indefinite hiatus last year, When Marnie Was There marks the last film we'll see from the studio for some time to come. In that light, it's dimly disappointing and doesn't hold a candle to their '80s and '90s output."
rotten," This fascinating historical tale is badly crowded by a bland love story, told mainly in flashbacks."
fresh," It shows Anderson to be one of the most challenging film-makers in America, if not the world."
fresh, The filmmakers employ a powerful technique of interspersing newsreel footage with wrenching on-camera interviews of survivors and sequences of actors reciting from the letters and memoirs of the Westerners on the scene.
rotten," In every department, the new movie is a blander affair [than the first]."
rotten, the cinematic equivalent of Jessica Simpson - pretty to look at but vacuous in nature and thought
rotten, Some amusing bits punctuate the tone-deaf proceedings like actual bits of chicken in Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup.
fresh," Logan may be a slower, more character-driven comic book movie, but it's incredibly gritty and violent as well,"
rotten, The hypocritical misogyny of He Got Game is a fundamental weakness that reviewers so far have been happy to downplay or even to dismiss.
rotten," A truly wretched comedy that's full of major, major miscalculations."
fresh," Wax on, wax off...you decide."
rotten," Here to prove that misogyny never quite goes out of style in the cinema, French director Bertrand Bonello presents this wearisome, questionable spectacle."
rotten, The joyless tone seeps off the screen and ultimately takes its toll on the viewer.
rotten, Simply more mindless mayhem.
rotten," Like the politicians and political consultants it mocks, ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" doesn't completely deliver on what it promises."
rotten," Even for a farce, the situations stretch credulity far beyond the breaking point."
rotten, The politics of the boat as it reaches calamity are mostly reduced to a singular urge to kill one character.
fresh, The strength of Eagle vs Shark lies in its unconventional story with unconventional leads.
rotten," It's got a half-baked script full of holes, villains written in bold type and, even though it's based on a true story, concocted banality."
fresh," If you're open to the strange nature of the film and its duality, then you're in for a good time with a truly unique film."
rotten, Needs hosing down.
fresh," Côté's eerie fantasy drama juxtaposes the mundane and the parochial with the supernatural, to sometimes disquieting effect."
rotten, An object lesson in how not to use likable stars.
rotten," It would be nice to report that Six ... has an eye for horrific imagery and a head full of fresh ideas - or, barring all that, that he's simply a hard-working hack. But this is lazy moviemaking based on the thinnest of concepts."
fresh," Unusual, uncomfortable, austere, and tragic, this drama film will likely give you the bitterest taste you've had this year in the movie theaters."
fresh, Tim Burton more than redeems himself by resurrecting something he made nearly 30 years ago.
fresh," All told, it's not a classic, but there are worse ways to spend an hour (and for a good cause, maybe)."
rotten," A lot like spending time with friends of friends that are amusing, maybe even fascinating, but ultimately really annoying"
fresh," Shows just what you can do with a carefully constructed plot and lovingly drawn characters - even if, in the end, neither of them is particularly lovable."
fresh," When the newspaper thriller's obituary is written, State of Play may well be cited as the genre's last gasp."
fresh," A charming, funny, reactionary mating comedy from the Judd Apatow factory..."
rotten," The queer aspect initially makes it feel subversive, but What Keeps You Alive is conventional from the get-go."
rotten," At first, anyway, it's mildly amusing. But before too long, all this whimsical, metaphysical meandering and smarty-pants wordplay grows wearisome."
rotten, It stocks its screenplay with more conflicts than it can possibly handle honestly in two hours.
rotten," The story is boosted by some decent acting and a few genuine laughs, but not enough to justify the cost of a theater ticket."
fresh, a realistic (for Hollywood) thriller that proceeds at a breakneck pace...Kim Basinger and Chris Evans do terrific jobs. 
rotten," Stuck somewhere between straight thriller, comic tale and over-the-top schlockfest..."
fresh, A delightfully dark fairy tale!
rotten, An ill-advised prequel to 1974's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre...
rotten, Could just as well have been titled Dumb Then Dumber for the way its plot makes decreasing sense even by the low standards of B horror flicks.
fresh, Les images tordues du film sont impossible à oublier...
fresh," The whole thing is cheerfully engaging, thanks to inspired direction by Luke Greenfield."
fresh," Ultimately, this is a two-hour video game. But the filmmakers play it well."
fresh, García Bernal quietly carries this film as a soft-spoken kid in blue jeans and untucked shirt.
rotten," (The Great Wall) doesn't prove how much China can spend on a movie, it proves how much China can waste on one."
rotten," Ultimately, the images stay with you for all the wrong reasons."
rotten," The concept here had potential, but the execution makes it completely dead on arrival."
fresh," Brutal violence, death, history in agonizing Holocaust tale. "
rotten," The whole thing makes you feel, oh I don't know, a little dirty."
rotten," A trippy, uneven ride whose best assets are its imagination, Heath Ledger's final performance, and the three surprise stars who act as his replacements."
rotten, It's too cold and too uninterested in talk in general and the stories people tell themselves about their romantic lives in particular to do its premise justice.
fresh," This film doesn't just appeal to budding Vermeers but anyone who likes serious, intelligent drama and gentle erotic tension."
rotten, Tom Cruise is CAPTAIN EO!
rotten," The imagery is creepy and the pacing is brisk, but the story is a faded carbon copy of other, better serial killer thrillers, and the new additions to the Hellraiser mythology rob the Cenobites of their deviant allure and otherworldly menace."
rotten," How does that writer take a whack at that franchise, and come up with something as convoluted and puffy as this?"
rotten," Thanks, Kevin Williamson. Thank you a whole lot."
fresh," Potter's take on the '60s occasionally slides into Big Chill cliché, but with her actors, she's on virgin ground."
rotten," Nearly two hours of drab, dull-as-dishwater footage of the politely taciturn painter quietly going about his business..."
rotten," One of the most contrived, formula-ridden, shamelessly manipulative explosions of stacked-deck writing, star-indulgent schmaltz it's ever been my lot to suffer through."
fresh," All is forgiven in a wild money shot defining moment, when passion blooms in stereo off camera, as a studio hideaway's flashing voice level meters dance around, in synch with sex. A match ultimately made in digital heaven."
fresh," Bawdy, naughty-mouthed cowboy-movie parody goes places Mel Brooks and the Farrelly brothers never dared."
fresh, It's a shame the lack of originality becomes a distraction forty minutes in and the spectacle isn't enough to stem the overriding sense of déjà vu.
rotten," It's not great, but it could lead to interesting discussion."
fresh, The animation is marked by a simple sort of elegance; the story lucidly and lyrically moves back and forth from 1982 to 1966 ...
rotten," I have long praised Hallstrom's ability to bring life to material that should have been dead on the screen, but here it's the opposite. He has never directed rapid-fire door-slamming, disguise-switching comedy before; and it turns out he can't."
fresh," This is smart, witty and beautifully crafted -- exactly what you want from a family film."
fresh, Entertaining story of the tenderizing of a critical and persnickety writer.
fresh," It's a fantastical adventure with a grounding in the modern (circa 1982) world of suburbia, divorce, and adolescent anxiety, and E.T. is the ultimate imaginary playmate come to life."
fresh," A good superhero story and above average genre, I dare say, and I think it's all due to the splendid decision of selecting Cumberbacht for the main role. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh," The essential climate of the movie - the climate of hysteria, dysfunction and mendacity, backed up by an enduring, essentially optimistic and arguably idiotic culture of popular patriotism ... feels strikingly authentic to our historical moment."
fresh, a gripping collection of vignettes that show a side of life most of us will hopefully never have to witness first-hand.
fresh," The film shares Mohamed Nasheed's pessimism, but it's also able to celebrate that wonderfully stubborn individual's constant need to fight on regardless of the eventual result."
fresh, This is an accomplished and moving and solid drama from a director who seems on the verge of giving us a great movie sometime soon.
rotten," Someone decided to put Rashomon in a Cuisinart along with A Few Good Men, The Usual Suspects and A Soldier's Story, and hit the pulverize button while forgetting to replace the top."
rotten, A sort of grumpy-old-man comedy that looks as if it could have been directed by anyone.
fresh," When one of his pet ants is killed, Scott (Rudd) threatens the villain with a wee fist: ""You're going to regret this!"" This movie about shrinkage has a nice sense of proportion. "
fresh, This drama is based on the Bible.
rotten," An important, always absorbing topic goes awry in this curious, sometimes suspect hodge-podge of a documentary."
rotten," By definition, a romcom should be at least a touch romantic and amusing but this manages to be neither."
rotten," A bombastic and incoherent world overflowing with half-baked allegory, baffling characterisation and back-breaking mythological portent. It's a laudably bold, utterly exhausting, mess of a film."
fresh," The premise is modern, and brilliant; it could easily be used to delve substantively into the new, post-feminist (evolving? constricting? wounded?) male psyche. But the film eschews anything too complicated or dark, so laughs are counterbalanced with shru"
rotten," With his incessant cackling and jigging and adorable lisp, Hoffman is an unbearable force of nature, while Portman is disappointing as a young adult stuck in neutral."
rotten," Oh yeah, divorce is hysterical."
fresh," A ""smart"" thriller - the title itself is intended to convey that this is an ideal summer popcorn movie - but it's a little too tricky for its own good."
rotten, [Spike Lee's] new version of 'Oldboy' feels like someone stranded by material rather than someone liberated by it.
fresh, The movie still entertains -- thanks to Downey's staccato rhythms and Foxx's secret melodies. But it remains flawed.
fresh," Everything Up does with quiet, time-bestriding imagination is a triumph."
fresh, This may not have it all but it's another step forward and a fun night out.
rotten, Another body-switching comedy? Seriously?
rotten," The film is heavy-going, unformed and self-indulgent, with characters who are neither sympathetic nor (crucially) interesting."
rotten," Mental illness is used to make the film more 'exciting', which is insensitive and doesn't work."
rotten," It's not really ""about"" anything (that's soooooo bourgeois! ""About""? I mean, really!)."
rotten," Son of Joseph is an unquestionably smart, good-looking film, but I appreciate it more than I enjoyed it."
fresh, Astounding and thrilling.
fresh," In his lovely new film, Argentine director Daniel Burman mixes reality with fiction in inventive ways."
fresh, ...there's no denying that what the film gently says does matter.
rotten," Fast & Furious is exactly and precisely what you'd expect. Nothing more, unfortunately."
rotten, ...worthless garbage...
rotten, Revenge could not have been served more cold. And stale.
rotten, Vapid live-action update.
rotten, The material cries out for a more disinterested eye.
rotten, Too often revolves around the battery life of a cell phone and the amount of air remaining. That threat is terrifying in our mind but difficult to see on screen.
fresh," Accept this Call, it's well worth it."
rotten," Remake, reboot, re-envisioning -- whatever you call it, it amounts to the same thing: a cynical money grab."
rotten," Just as people clicking on your profile or liking your Insta means you have done something ""good"", people hissing at your film now affords you a weird kind of success. Only The Neon Demon isn't good, and most Instagram pictures are rubbish."
fresh," One of the two or three cleverest, most probing of Hollywood satires."
fresh," All this is heartwarming, in a bloody, ursine-centric way."
rotten," Mooney denies this childlike fish-out-of-water any deeper layers of anxiety, dread, or anger. His trauma remains abstract."
rotten," The result of the new Nightmare is, at best, a kind of stand-off between predictability and competent execution."
rotten," Visually, the film is an uninteresting as the similarly dour Don't Touch the Axe, and now Breillat's health is failing it may be time she hung-up her viewfinder."
fresh," Helmer Nelson has fashioned a clever premise, helped along by a smart ensemble that manages to highlight Shakespeare's work without parodying it--no small accomplishment."
rotten, This is one shelved project that should have stayed on the shelf.
fresh," ""My life has value,"" Ms. Laude once declared. She was right, and this film takes that truth to heart."
fresh, Don't miss this harrowing movie if you're in the mood for adventure more thrilling than anything Hollywood has to offer these days.
rotten," Clunky, dramatically inert, ideologically repugnant, and just a plain old bore, The Host may be the worst thing anyone involved has ever been affiliated with. In some instances, that may also prove true for the audience."
fresh, A bloody 1985 double homicide and the media hysteria that encircled it are revisited in this deeply sourced but frustrating investigation of whether justice was truly served.
rotten, This almost laughable mock-adventure should give Warner Bros at least one good weekend before receipts take a nosedive and audiences discover they are the ones being sucker-punched.
rotten," A high-gloss exploitation picture, obsessed with the Death Jesus conquered, rather than the Life he gave -- and gives."
rotten," Lean and mildly entertaining with unflinching violence, but it's ultimately too shallow and offers very little that's surprising, clever or inventive. "
rotten, A heist thriller that feels suspiciously like a feature-length commercial for expensive liquor.
rotten," The Monuments Men - with its shifting tone between light comedy and drama - rarely gets the viewer invested enough to really care what happens to them. And that's unfortunate, because it really is a fascinating footnote in history. "
rotten," It doesn't quite gel as either a proper whodunnit, an insight into a killer's mind, a debate about lyrics in heavy metal music or a gripping legal case."
fresh," [Matthew McConaughey] is, in short, not only the film's motor but its moral justification, the fullest representation of a state of affairs and an era marked by social, political and economic decline. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh," Taking its cue from Michael Haneke's deeper, crueler Funny Games, The Cabin in the Woods explores why we-sicko viewers-take pleasure in the suffering of others. "
fresh," This is one woman's journey, and we as viewers should feel privileged to have been invited along. "
fresh, It's fun to see Walker do a double take at a perilous move of Belle's and then find a less risky alternative. The pair seem like they're having a good time in this buddy action movie. It seems a fitting curtain call for a likable actor gone too soon.
rotten, Aspires to the heights of a Jean-Pierre Melville or Fritz Lang but proves to be more along the mediocre lines of an M. Night Shyamalan.
fresh," How could it be entertaining and engaging enough to justify watching the game, instead of simply playing it Adam Robitel's slick, good-looking film takes up the challenge, and succeeds to a point."
fresh, One of the best movies of the year.
rotten," The director has a knack for constructing cool moments, but consistently fails to tie them together cohesively. He has neat ideas, but has trouble executing them."
rotten," Truly, Gnomeo & Juliet has to be regarded as one of the worst Shakespeare adaptations of all time"
fresh, The picture looks lovely and despite keeping us in the dark about Ramunujan's breakthroughs it builds to an effective climax as he finds acceptance in the college's hallowed walls.
fresh," Built on fantasy stereotypes, it nonetheless contains enough epic action, narrative momentum and spit-and-sawdust pre-CGI special effects to hold the attention."
fresh," At their best, the Muppets embody a sort of moral anarchy, as the weirdest stuff can happen at any given moment, but you know it's going to be funny and you know no one is going to get hurt (they are just puppets after all)."
rotten," As I sat in the theater, I wondered to myself, ""Is this the female identification movie that women want to see and I just don't get it?"""
rotten," An unsatisfying, shamelessly derivative mix of elements from Inception, Flatliners, and Shutter Island."
rotten, There are chick flicks and upchuck flicks. The movie Because I Said So is an upchuck chick flick.
fresh," Writer-director Sean McGinley based his title character on the Amazing Kreskin, and it provides a suitable mainstream vehicle for Malkovich's bruised aloofness."
rotten," Margot has no sense of balance, or nuance, or even mitigating psychological weight."
fresh, [Blends] playful spectacle with a sense of bonding among a chosen family.
rotten, The story's flights of conspiratorial fancy come across as more silly than scary.
fresh," It's a less playful enterprise than the original, but meets the era's darker demands for action reboots with machine-tooled efficiency and a hint of soul."
rotten," Spy isn't a movie, but a sideshow brutally dragged out for two hours with content we've seen done before and with infinitely more precision. "
rotten, Skip this feature and wait until it makes its way to DVD or television.
rotten, ...a big-screen feature with a direct-to-video plot.
rotten, It pairs Diane Keaton with Michael Douglas to simulate the sort of second-chance AARP romance that's intended to stimulate grizzled audiences who see one movie in theaters every three or four years.
rotten," It's almost COMPLETELY forgettable! (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, Nudity, Sexual Content, etc. - also Available)"
fresh," Blond, blue-eyed and coolly composed, whether calmly wiping his palms before shaking hands with the Queen ... or nervelessly tackling Brazilian forward Jairzinho, he always looked as though he'd stepped from the pages of Roy of the Rovers."
rotten, The film is best in those rare moments when the pets' owners are present.
fresh," Youth drifts along easily, moving from truism to truism like a well-thumbed book of quotations."
rotten, It's no surprise that Reese Witherspoon's headlong jump into romantic comedy doesn't live up to classic or modern date movie standards.
fresh," Those looking to be thrilled, and who enjoy a few twists and turns in a dark-hearted thriller, The Girl on the Train will definitely appease."
rotten, Big stinking pile of dino poo-poo.
rotten," Predestination isn't quite one of Hawke's worst duds, but it wastes a wonderfully loopy premise by getting lost in all the swerves."
rotten," Instead of leaning into the very funny people populating it, the movie gets distracted with a laborious setup... and then a heist... and a prom... all just so it can keep skipping class."
rotten," Evan Almighty is an ungainly melding of religious paean, big-budget studio comedy, feel-good family niceties and summer-blockbuster spectacle."
fresh, Hawks conducts the intrigue at such a frantic lick - achieving speed by means of overlapping dialogue and manoeuvring the actors within the frame rather than by quick cutting - that we are willingly swept along. 
fresh," Aesthetically, the film is phenomenal. Streep and Adams deliver fantastic performances and the parallels between the characters were fascinating."
fresh, Could have been a little more darkly comic in places but the performances are superb.
rotten, This almost laughably shallow film is ultimately more interested in Alma's outfits than anything else.
fresh," ...by every [criterion other than the animation quality], Flushed Away is marvelous, with an unbeatable cast bringing the most to a script that is already hilarious."
rotten," Vox Lux is a movie that makes you ask the question, Why am I supposed to care about any of this? "
rotten, The melodramatic love triangle that fuels the movie's story until and beyond the infamous attack on Pearl Harbor is both clumsy and unmoving
rotten," Armour-clanging, cloak-swishing tosh with okay battles, terrible dialogue and sadly little horror or heroism."
rotten," This is not a feel-good movie. This is the frigid, hard-to-embrace cinematic opposite of a feel-good movie, in fact -- all wrapped in one long, dark metaphor for depression."
fresh," An unflinching, well-informed and thoroughly researched look at the American system of incarceration, specifically how the prison industrial complex affects people of color."
fresh, A buoyant good time in its warmly riotous celebration of individuality and friendship.
rotten, You won't believe how tiresome bad taste has become.
rotten," Not content to be just another dumb high school flick, it's actually teaching young, virginal viewers to treat women like stupid, submissive slut-cattle for the rest of their lives."
rotten," Whatever word is the opposite of ""page-turner"" - a story that sits there lifeless, trapped in a boredom of its own making - would aptly fit director Tate Taylor's movie adaptation."
rotten, Even a phalanx of good actors can't save this-less than-Magnificent Seven...
fresh," In less than an hour and a half, the athletes profiled in the documentary will frustrate you, amaze you, make you laugh and make you cry -- but you'll never feel sorry for them."
fresh," Watching this, I was reminded of a similar kind of story structure in the award-winning film, 'Argo'. This film isn't as good as 'Argo,' but it isn't bad, either. It is well-acted and the story is compelling."
rotten," After finally seeing the film, there's no longer much mystery as to why the studio pulled it from awards season."
rotten," In playing it safe, Baddiel has gutted the dramatic potential from his own premise and the result is a strangely meaningless, poorly plotted comedy that never generates big laughs."
fresh," Buy a ticket, enjoy watching ninjas on zip lines and The Rock kicking ass, and when the lights go up try to avoid thinking about it on any deeper level. "
rotten, [Snyder] twists the brawn and battle into a cartoonish FX extravaganza with severed body parts and globules of blood flying across the screen.
fresh, Knocked Up is a good film. Lurking beneath the surface is a great one just dying to break free.
rotten," A very unappealing animated feature about Babe Ruth, baseball, and family values."
fresh," Child 44 is not a bad crime-thriller, but it could have been way better, especially given the talent involved."
rotten," The result feels like a film that was made not because the director had an irresistible itch to tell the story but because crime capers based in North India, filled with sex and swear words, are supposed to be cool."
rotten, Dark and glacially paced way to wrap up a trilogy
fresh," The Theory of Everything is the type of inspirational story that is so often told in biopics. It is beautifully shot, emotionally driven, and a masterclass in acting."
rotten," Writer-director Steven Sommers of the MUMMY films handles action scenes well, but is poor with directing acting or even giving us a very good story."
fresh, A fine political thriller.
rotten," With the sort of last-minute plot twist that sank M. Night Shyamalan's career, Red Lights comes to an unexpected, risible end. "
rotten, It's hard to care about the fate of a marriage that never quite comes into focus.
rotten," Whatever you think is going to happen to these fellas, does."
fresh, Remember Boyle and MacDonald's names: you'll be hearing them a lot when awards season comes around.
rotten," The new film's fire-power is too sloppy, too wide-spread; it barely scathes even the easy target of an American television talent show complete with Simon Cowell clone."
fresh," Clever subversion, accidentally...a beautiful mess, no other way I can think of describing it...constantly fascinated by what's happening on screen."
fresh," Streep's latest mom role, as Ricki Rendazzo in Ricki and the Flash, has a light, Mamma Mia! vibe, but it still hits all those hot buttons. "
rotten," I think Palast and Ambrose hope to appeal to attention-deficient millennials, but their reference points are decades out of date."
fresh, Leaves the latest Shrek lying in the dirt like a beat-up has-been.
fresh," [Bryan] Cranston plays Trumbo with an edgy, raging wit."
fresh, [W]hat Jackson does with the central storyline ... is quite effective here.
fresh," There are many sweet laughs and joking allusions to horror and prison-break movies, but the Pixar gang gets at the most primary fear -- being cast off and no longer of use."
rotten," It's powerful, but fatally contrived"
fresh," From a dramatic standpoint, the film is equally effective in the way that it includes the expected pulpy thrills and weirdo humor but also some unexpectedly affecting dramatic moments."
rotten," You can tell Hill could craft an entertaining film in a mode he's comfortable with, but aiming for profundity finds his reach exceeding his grasp."
fresh," First-time director Gerard Johnstone may not possess the wild visual invention of his patron Peter Jackson, but he's ruthlessly proficient at old-school scares."
rotten," The movie is steeped in a world-weariness that flatters a certain kind of know-it-all. Swinton and Hiddleston, looking like twins, take disaffection to the moon. Not since Weekend at Bernie's have two actors done more to promote the cause of corpses."
fresh, A Ghost Story can seem more like a creative exercise than a fully formed narrative construct.
rotten, Zemeckis has been seduced by the siren call of motion capture... Memo to Zemeckis: come back to earth!
fresh," Filmmaker Dean Devlin assembles the movie with gritty, sleek style, offering just enough character development to hook the audience before things turn viciously over the top. And also rather silly."
fresh," Genuinely funny and gleefully entertaining, its creators aren't afraid to throw everything they've got at the screen to see what sticks - and a lot of it does. "
rotten," Serves up the usual homilies, but it lacks the quirky density and cinematic snap of, for instance, Jonathan Demme in his Melvin and Howard period."
rotten, The film comes off more like a drunken recollection by a war correspondent than something that might actually have happened.
rotten," A rambling, meandering experience ..."
fresh," Actor Majd Mastoura makes pouting, uptight Hedi a completely unpredictable force in the film, while director Mohamed Ben Attia subtly weaves the seismic social changes brought on by the Arab Spring into this sly, poignant drama."
fresh," While 'Die' is hardly in a class with the best Bond blockbusters, it's a substantial improvement on the thoroughly mediocre 1999 installment 'The World is Not Enough'..."
rotten, Uninspired biopic sheds little light on unfathomable maritime mystery.
fresh," Both the best and worst thing about Russell's new film, I Heart Huckabees, is the way the filmmaker has completely bought into his own image."
rotten, There comes a time when we must stop kidding ourselves. These 'Hobbit' films - with 'The Desolation of Smaug' representing the shank of the trilogy - are not real movies.
fresh," ""Whitney: 'Can I Be Me'"" has no conspiracies to uncover. It just has a story to tell, and it does that incredibly compellingly."
fresh, The story is excellently conceived and planned.
rotten," An even lazier, even dumber re-hash of Valentine's Day - a movie that was already very lazy and dumb to begin with."
rotten," What happens when an unnecessary sequel, CGI aplenty, and usually good actors get snow-plowed into each other at hyper-Zamboni speed-none will survive."
rotten," Like childbirth, (it's) very messy and painful at times. But like raising children, there will be a few tears and a few laughs and somehow you'll get through it."
fresh," Captain Phillips not just an exceptional tale of grace under pressure, but an actively engaging experience as well."
fresh," A sweetheart of a movie, enough to make up for its clattering screenplay."
fresh, Minor but racy and enjoyably rude.
rotten," It's akin to watching someone get their knuckles cracked by a ruler, over and over again."
fresh," A boy's adventure yarn in the most traditional, unabashedly entertaining sense."
rotten, hearkens back with great hope and poor follow-through to Universal's classic horror films
fresh, A chilling anatomy of a marriage beginning and ending.
rotten," The makeup design and chase scenes are rote, and the little dramatic conflict - arguments over where to hide - traffic in the oldest clichés in the genre."
fresh," Caught between efforts to redress Eurocentric accounts of the conquest of Mexico and a tendency to slide into old-movie melodramatics, Carrasco's film is often gorgeous, never less than entertaining and occasionally moving."
rotten," If you aren't a fan of Witchcraft based horror films, this isn't going to change your mind. At times confusing, creepy, and has brief spurts of over the top bloodletting. I left wondering, what did I just watch? "
rotten, Not especially funny or sexy.
fresh," In a Valley of Violence is a fusion and modernization of old genres, particularly Spaghetti Western, and though not without flaws, it is mostly an entertaining thrill ride."
rotten, Bynum's messy debut film is only bearable thanks to Chalamet's charisma.
fresh," It's hard to dislike a guy who, at his worst, is a man (as Landis puts it) on a ""philanthropic binge."""
fresh," The Girl With All the Gifts is just plain great. It's captivating, entertaining, provocative, and most of all, it's the freshest take on the zombie genre we've seen in years."
fresh," By the end, despite the surface-y quality of the treatment, you're caught up in the suspense, the horse-race aspect of a very particular pursuit of knowledge and excellence."
fresh," It's one of the most refreshing and satisfying Marvel movies in some time, precisely because its willing to do many things that Marvel hasn't done before."
fresh, Cynical and sentimental it may be but it still packs a punch.
fresh," Chicago is no Cabaret, but if all you want from your evening's entertainment is jazz, it's all that."
fresh," A crucial scene at a train station ... is almost heartstopping, but the film is never so intimidating that it won't charm audiences from Kun's age and up."
rotten," Essentially, [this] is the same as most stories of lust and infidelity -- two people who 'can't control' their desires end up hurting others, lying, and denying responsibility for their actions."
rotten," When it's all wet, Blue Crush is highly enjoyable. When it's on dry land, though, this surfer-girl melodrama starts gasping like a beached grouper."
rotten," It's all extraordinarily sentimental and manipulative, weighed down by Horn's mannered, grating performance and incessant voiceover narration."
rotten," Its austere gloom feels oppressive and monotonous, undercutting its psychological impact."
rotten," Neither a Scorsesian slice of life nor a social satire, this infuriating movie adds up to almost nothing."
rotten," There's way too little danger and too much method in the cushy, tasteful, icy cool A Dangerous Method."
rotten," Imagine that your Facebook page, complete with that airbrushed profile photo, can go out into ""real"" society and leave you at home twiddling your fingers, living vicariously through it. That's the general concept of Surrogates, where humans stay sh"
rotten," Lynch's bizarre, dream-like approach is as fascinating as ever... and every bit as frustrating as well."
fresh, [A] sweltering and pristine portrait of one Marine's experience of the first Persian Gulf war.
fresh," HAYWIRE is a pared-down, almost simplistic action movie, mostly designed to showcase the beauty and power of Soderbergh's new star, female mixed martial arts fighter Carano."
rotten," Excellent soundtrack, appalling acting, especially by Gooding."
rotten," Why didn't the maestro didn't just go the whole hog and rename it ""Jazz Hands: A Love Story""? A bottle of your best champagne says he thought about it."
fresh," LaBute is very good at kicking over rocks, and even better at examining what crawls out from under them."
fresh," It is not a perfect movie, but it is a consistently committed one."
rotten, It is a generic multiplex space holder in between better cartoon releases.
rotten," The studio's strategy: Hire the same director, employ the services of a couple of the same writers, offer the same standard-issue plotting and similar comic riffs, and then kick back and practice saying, ""Show me the money."""
rotten, There's no doubt that Anderson is an inventive filmmaker bursting with ideas. The problem is that he hasn't found a powerful story to contain them.
rotten," Williams has become a comedic glass ceiling, a black hole of laughs that guarantees every scene he's in will make nails on a chalkboard sound appealing."
fresh," Some thrillers settle into a rut of adequacy, rarely spiking above or below the baseline. Not The International. Director Tom Tykwer's new picture is all over the place, geographically and in terms of audience satisfaction."
fresh," As an entryway into new ways of thinking about the self, the universe, and the vast infinite whatnot of whatever (you know what we mean, oh wise one), this little movie is big."
rotten," The peculiar, comic-book-like computer graphics -- artful at first -- finally overtake Blood and make it look like a video game instead of a graceful, graphic martial arts movie."
fresh," It's certainly the best mainstream thriller since The Insider, and an audacious political statement from a director who has everything to lose. Don't miss it."
rotten, At the narrative level there is an overlap of clichés... [Full review in Spanish]
rotten," The filmmakers take the most direct route to action thrills with cartoonish characters, outlandish violence and nary a moment of psychology or subtlety."
rotten, Alice Through the Looking Glass is a needless sequel that at least gets some points for imaginative effort.
fresh," A work full of happy intuitions, as brave as it is sincere and crossed by much talent in all its frames. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten," There is next to no dialogue in the film's final 30 minutes %u2013 just a torrent of killing, blood and violence. The film's target market of young testosterone-charged males will no doubt be eager to immerse themselves in this blood-fest of stunts and sp"
fresh, Gorgeous to look at and an absolute feast of strong and interesting acting.
rotten," in a better world, [it] would have focused on Macy and that pitch perfect brand of eager anxiety that can . . . make any scene worth watching"
fresh," New Zealand writer-director Taika Waititi blends sharply cynical humour with huge heart in arguably his best film to date, Hunt for the Wilderpeople."
fresh," A confident, eccentric debut about a trio of shambling and guileless friends who become the Candides of crime, Rocket feels particularly refreshing because it never compromises on its delicate deadpan sensibility."
rotten," Will undoubtably please its target audience of teens and early twenty-somethings, but may prove to be a bit too much for older audiences."
rotten," Director Tomas Alfredson has a feel for the downscale look of London during the period that the novel depicts, but little else. Stick with the Guinness version."
fresh," Can't be defined by its 'R' rating or by the 'period piece' label. It may be about a king, but it speaks to the royalty in all of us. "
rotten," The imagery is almost unendurably self-conscious, and Gainsbourg, with her low, musical, murmuring voice, gives the kind of performance you suspect she can do standing on her head. Her final lines are irritating beyond belief."
fresh," The children dominate the film, and their openness and enthusiasm overwhelm any latent cynicism."
rotten," The only truly offensive thing about Tomcats, a bottom feeder of a gross-out comedy desperately wanting to be the next Road Trip or American Pie, is how numbingly unfunny an hour and a half can be."
fresh," The film is quiet and accumulative, staying with its subject through emotional outpourings and everyday transactions; the audience is embedded. "
fresh," It's smooth and competently crafted, an efficient thriller punctuated by startling bursts of violence and nuanced performances from Norton, whose tough-cop routine masks a sort of cerebral tenderness, and the ever-reliable Noah Emmerich."
fresh," The director carefully avoids turning something that might feel foreign to the audience into a film about ""the other."""
fresh, This intersection of nature and culture is filled with insight.
fresh, It loses its way after a while but the performances are excellent and there's some jaunty dialogue.
rotten," Clever enough to provoke a few abrupt laughs along the way, this big screen debut for two television stalwarts... is sabotaged by some frightfully on-the-nose expository dialogue and an adamantly prosaic visual style."
fresh," This movie is done so well that even if you're like me and don't do crossword puzzles, you'll still be entertained."
fresh," Mixing droll animation, stock footage and a restrained number of talking head interviews, the director Penny Lane's biography has all the whimsy of a tall tale, until a late change in tone surprises with genuine emotion. Nuts! is really a kick."
rotten," Whereas you only needed a single finger to play the game, not one brain cell is required to process this busy, fizzy, empty-calorie calamity."
fresh," With material this familiar, casting is crucial. And Burnett has a pair of aces up his sleeve in Paul Rudd and Craig Roberts ..."
rotten, A dull waste of a compelling comic-book character.
rotten," I appreciate the film's attempt to expose systemic racism through Baltimore's overwhelming infiltration of rampaging pests, but it's too often distracted with experimentation."
fresh," López's astonishing, beautiful film remains a state-of-the-nation allegory of a different stripe."
rotten," What is this, an inspirational poster?"
rotten, Let's just say Indiana Jones riding out a nuclear blast in a refrigerator is no longer the most far-fetched thing I've ever seen in the movies.
rotten," The biggest fault is that comparatively little attention is given to the monsters. We see a swish of tail here, a giant foot there, but too often we're denied a lingering look at the destroyers."
fresh, Sombre yet powerful.
fresh, A playful comedy laced with heartbreak.
rotten," Coogan is definitely funny, but even he can't inject the needed energy into this tired film."
fresh," If you still get a thrill from seeing the MGM lion or hearing the Twentieth Century Fox fanfare, then that's - or, rather, ""Hail, Caesar!"" is - entertainment."
rotten," Kenneth Branagh's direction imitates De Palma's multi-angled voyeurism, but the trite visual tricks interrupt the clipped language and tense interaction that are British theater's domain."
rotten," If the film didn't take its own intended profundity so seriously, it might get a pass."
rotten," This is foul-mouthed, gross, and about as relevant to either Hanukkah or Christmas as hanging a turd on a Christmas tree."
fresh," A remarkable film that skillfully mixes the luminous and the harsh, the beautiful and the horrific parts of the human adventure"
rotten," The more I see of their work, the more I realise that directors Ed Zwick and Sam Mendes have one thing very sharply in common -- both are filmmakers who make movies that they think are far more important than they actually are."
fresh," You can't say this film didn't scare you, even if you don't want to admit it. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten," Like a bag of money in the woods, you should leave this movie alone."
rotten," ""Wrinkle"" fine but fails to soar."
fresh," Bullock offers impressive, restrained support that gives the sometimes flighty film a necessary emotional anchor."
rotten," Even with a gripping subject like blues-singing convicts, the documentary ""Music from the Big House"" has a disconcerting emotional distance."
rotten," The problem is the screenplay, which has weak, unforceful dialogue and tends to substitute dramatic events for characterization."
rotten," Wants to have its pie and eat it too - lobbing political hand grenades and then running away, refusing to engage in the consequences the scenarios set up."
fresh," Steeped in the raw mix of ska and punk sound as expression of the youth alienation and misguided rage of those tumultuous times, an alarming voice of the surging army of jobless youth back then dubbed 'no hopers.'"
fresh, It's bold and stunning with great characters and original storytelling.
rotten," Tedious, preaching-to-the-converted drama with lifeless direction and a shockingly ham-fisted script."
fresh, Jeremy Northam gives a deft performance and Steve Zahn is especially brilliant in delineating his character's transformation from illiterate lug to finicky choreographer.
fresh," Its imagery is never less than breathtakingly beautiful, and is occasionally truly awesome..."
fresh," A truly sweet, funny, and downright likable comedy."
rotten," Prospect ultimately doesn't quite satisfy, but the filmmaker's excavations do hold promise, perhaps yielding something rich at a later date."
fresh," The low budget makes everything look grimy, gutter-tech and real, and that suddenly seems striking and visually fresh compared to the slickly digital effects we're all used to being bombarded by now."
fresh," One of those increasingly rare things in modern cinema -- a deeply-felt, powerful film about religious faith that has no interest in peddling the gospel to the viewer."
rotten," It feels like a product, shaped to the point of anonymity."
fresh, Ron Howard as director has fashioned a drama about the slow hatching of Nash's heart.
fresh, It really does get better - at the movies anyway.
rotten, There comes a point at which you have enhanced soldiers fighting with non-enhanced people stuck in the middle...where you're just remaking Terminator 2.
rotten, Director Jason R. Goode creates a taut mood and gives us plenty of lovely but deadly landscape to ponder. But Numb is likely to leave sensible filmgoers cold.
rotten," Mary Queen of Scots doesn't have the musty feel of period-bound drama but it doesn't spring to vivid life, either. So, no hails for this queen."
fresh," The film's slick and entertaining, an obvious must-see for musical hounds. It holds water for laypeople, though, because the insights into a communal creative process are so sharp."
fresh," You would be perfectly at liberty to find it boring and empty, but also to understand the tiny resonances that have made it one of the best reviewed films of 2006 in America. Somehow it does strike home."
fresh," Giving a seriously Marlene-Dietrich-like performance in her first major role, Ni Ni is spellbinding as the hooker with a heart of gold."
rotten," Early on ""Black Death"" falls victim to its own sluggish sickness, its narrative drive proving no match for the aggressively rotted pallor, dour acting and tiresomely handheld you-are-there aesthetics."
rotten," [The film is] supposed to serve as a reminder that, low moments and all, this is truly still a wonderful life[.] Instead, it's a reminder that Robinson and Williams have each made some wonderful movies. But this isn't one of them."
fresh," There are only a handful of great films based around newspapers and their investigation of real events... Now, thanks to Tom McCarthy's stunning Spotlight, we have one more."
fresh," An ambling narrative, but an atmospheric one that feels authentic despite its unlikely character pairings."
fresh," Some may not have the patience to stick with the film while it almost floats along, but for those willing to enjoy the remarkable performances and restrained direction, there is plenty to reward a committed audience."
fresh, Brad Bird's smart decision to focus the story on Holly Hunter's Elastigirl makes it more in tune with the Time's Up era and the nascent powers of baby Jack-Jack steal the show.
rotten," While [this] version of the Christmas spirit on trial as written by John Hughes isn't awful, it's also more disappointing than Seaton's take nearly half a century earlier. "
fresh," Amazingly detailed in its narrative cohesion and editing, United 93 is a noble tribute to the tragedy of 9/11."
rotten," The movie has some beautiful and surreal images, but they deserve to be part of a deeper story. I didn't dislike this, but I didn't like it as much as I wanted to when I first saw the trailer."
rotten," Mr. Eastwood's ponderous direction, a clumsy script by Dustin Lance Black and ghastly slatherings of old-age makeup all conspire to put the story at an emotional and historical distance. It's a partially animated waxworks."
fresh," As always with Guiraudie's films, Staying Vertical shrewdly (and often hilariously) captures both the seriousness and the absurdity of sex ..."
rotten, It's amazing how Intruder's ending can ruin ninety minutes worth of buildup material in three seconds.It's amazing how Intruder's ending can ruin ninety minutes worth of buildup material in three seconds.
rotten," Things are pushed over the top rather successfully, but breaking momentum is a pretty big mistake for movie that wants to wow us with ruthless efficiency."
rotten," Rich with clichés, predictability, and happily ever afters, the story never ever leaves its comfort zone to challenge the characters and their relationships, to create tension or conflict, or to throw in the proverbial plot twist."
fresh," Hardy does an admirable job of making this monster human, which he achieves with surprising wit and a visceral, attention-grabbing passion."
rotten," It might be a solid hook if we thought their love was grand. Instead, it's kind of creepy."
rotten," A story with banal characters and wasted performances that falls into terrible paternalism, has a tangled action and it's poor and repetitive. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh," So skilfully does the film shield its hand that the final ""reveal"" actually comes as a disappointment - the enigma was truly much harder to bear."
rotten, The story is compelling but the telling less than ideal...ponderous rather than powerful.
fresh, Payne's beautiful command of his content diverts your attention away from the fact it's a typical road movie.
rotten," As biography, the movie is about as straightforward as one could imagine."
fresh, This inventive adaptation of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's children's book is beautifully realized in CG and stop-motion animation techniques.
fresh, This is the straightforward story of a family facing adversity head-on and making inroads against a rare disease.
fresh, This is a perfectly pleasant romcom with JLo doing what she does with tons of charisma. Could have used more romance and the lie feels a little stretched out but it's cute watch.
rotten, I can't adequately express how soul-sucking the crime subplot is here.
rotten," We've done the whole classless college comedy thing before, many times."
rotten, Yaron Zilberman's soap opera jettisons character plausibility in favor of pop psychology and leaden instrument analogies.
fresh," With a strong central performance and good special effects, The 6th Friend is just another addition to the growing catalogue of slasher films that is entirely watchable but adds nothing to this popular subgenre. "
rotten, Watching this kind of talent forced to muddle through this minefield of tired and embarrassing jokes is almost enough to make you reject the baby Jesus altogether.
rotten," Screenwriter Andy Bloom struggles to sustain the tensions between the holed-up thugs, with much of the talented supporting cast having too little to do."
rotten," Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters is big, LOUD and stupid."
fresh," Murray playing the glutton doesn't exactly fit the bill and for all the architectural care that's gone into Ember's creation, the secret at its heart is no mystery to us, the audience."
fresh, The ambitious $16 million production of the Rydell High School musical was as impressive as it was fun.
rotten," Like a taxidermied owl, ""Stoker"" is lovely to look at, but in the end it's hard to give a hoot."
rotten, Jack and the Giant Slayer is yet another passionless money grab that doesn't deserve the talent who just had the golden goose 'decorate' their resume.
rotten," I understand that the [modeling] industry is, by definition, misogynistic, but the director brings objectification of women to new heights."
fresh, Watching Atkinson pantomime an opera aria or engage in simple sight gags serves as a reminder of how few people are keeping this kind of visual comedy alive.
rotten," In a lot of ways the film treatment many fans have envisioned for years, and that's the problem; it doesn't quite communicate how special and affecting the material is to those unfamiliar with it."
rotten," It might be enough that ""12 Strong"" makes you feel good that the United States still produces guys like this. Too bad we didn't get to know about the real guys and their actual story."
fresh," A crisply measured character study with plenty of intriguing ideas, elevated by a terrific, finely calibrated performance by Sukowa."
rotten, 'Passengers' starts as a promising sci-fi story and closes as a heartbreaking and routinely romantic comedy. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh, This retelling is loving and gentle and lit like a 1940s musical.
fresh, [Craven finds] another new way to stoke our apprehensions of being caught vulnerable and helpless.
fresh, The takeaway message from Sgt. Will Gardner is that American veterans deserve better.
fresh," If you're willing to just sit back and enjoy all the nods, winks and over-the-top violence, Chuck Steel is a rather fun ride, with Mort and his animation team faithfully re-creating the slick and sleazy aesthetics of bargain-bin action and horror flicks."
rotten," Michael Schultz tries hard but can't quite manage to tie the varied elements of action, romance, comedy and musical video together, though as entertainment, this is engaging enough."
rotten," ""She's Lost Control"" sustains a mood of deepening alienation, but the attitude of the movie is too detached for it to be emotionally gripping, and its ending is botched."
rotten, A sexually frank but narratively flimsy girl-meets-girl romance that never gets under its gorgeous characters' amply exposed skin.
fresh," Organising his shots into thematic blocks - nostalgic byways, religion, bins - Barrett has the knack of drawing out visual details that cause nice eddies in the film's melancholy flow."
rotten," A plodding, play-it-safe rendition of The Family Feud."
rotten, A disappointment at nearly every turn.
rotten," Buddy the elf, like high school killers Eric and Alex, feels that he doesn’t fit in."
rotten, A stunning-looking Julie Christie running about Thomas Hardy's countryside is the major excuse for John Schlesinger's under-dramatized picture postcard.
fresh," ""BlacKkKlansman"" is sloppy and a bit all-over-the-place, but it is also a film that needs to be seen, made by an auteur who deserves- no, demands - that his voice is heard."
fresh," While I'm tired of the wretched tyranny of comic book flicks, I admit I liked Cumberbatch's picture. For the most part."
fresh," The filmmakers have a real love for the horror genre and its tropes and archetypes, and while much of what goes on here will have special resonance for fellow buffs, you don't have to be a scholar of spooky movies to appreciate how the story's being told."
fresh," A fascinating documentary about a life lived on the cutting edge of technology, and the definitive film about the net's own coming-of-age."
fresh," With co-writer Monica Johnson, his collaborator on Real Life and Modern Romance, Brooks has scripted the perfect outing for his gifts."
rotten, It is a shame when a movie like this is let down by the very reason for its existence. A slasher movie is only as strong as its slasher and the fear that slasher creates.
fresh," Anyone who has ever made a no-budget home movie, replete with exaggerated performances and makeshift props out of The Warriors, will hold a special place in their heart for Be Kind Rewind"
rotten, The whole film echoes Jolie's character -- stylish on the surface with no depth or substance.
fresh, Cut Bank has a clever premise and a cast that works hard to make it worthwhile to stick with the film through the clunky parts. 
fresh," An astounding, crushing film. "
rotten, Thin period piece.
rotten," This queasy, violent revenge fantasy becomes more preposterous as the body count rises. Taken is notable mainly for its racist stereotyping of Arabs and eastern Europeans."
fresh," Passable entertainment because it is more imaginative than most vampire films and because of Willem Dafoe's performance, but it should have been better."
fresh," The Green Hornet smoked crack with Superman and met CraigsList chicks with Wolverine. He's a bad influence and a good time. And he's much more entertaining on screen, too."
rotten," Do the filmmakers think we're morons? We're certainly treated as such, right from the beginning."
rotten, ...clumsy lunkhead slapstick...
rotten," A conventional, mildly frightening, low-grade horror flick with some humor (often unintentional) and as many gaps as a seven-year-old's mouth."
fresh," For me, the best reason to see this movie is that in the midst of her amusement Johnson feels sympathy and admiration for both cultures, and for all its glitz, the adaptation preserves and extends the same sentiments."
fresh," The quintessential big, loud, dumb summer action movie, this nonstop thrill ride is thunderously entertaining."
rotten, It's a measure of Cavill's intelligence that you can feel him resisting Goyer and Snyder's most egregious errors of judgment as Man Of Steel shakes itself apart. 
rotten," Joachim Trier is a Norwegian filmmaker who made a strong debut in 2011, with his film, ""Oslo, August 31."" ""Louder Than Bombs"" is his first English-language effort, and it's disappointing."
rotten," There are lots of punchy lines, but the one-joke movie doesn't have all that much to say."
fresh," Ahmad (Ahmad Razvi), the Pakistani immigrant who is the protagonist of Ramin Bahrani's Man Push Cart, goes through a Sisyphean daily grind."
rotten," I imagine if I were a woman, this movie would receive a very favorable review. However, I'm just a fat guy from Ohio."
rotten," You Are Here is a shockingly inept comedy, a project with the look and style of a mid-'90s Ivan Reitman or Harold Ramis comedy, not the first film from one of our finest TV writers."
rotten, Plan V is a film with a completely unsuccessful script and whose only success is the participation of most of its cast. [Full Review in Spanish]
fresh," There is a gravity to it, and a tug of sadness, that cannot be accounted for by the story."
rotten," What is Inland Empire -- which Lynch is understandably distributing himself -- about? What is it trying to say? If you figure that out, let me know."
fresh," The Hangover is sure to make moviegoers laugh so hard that their heads will hurt (in a good way, of course)."
fresh," Finding beauty in brutality, Revenge takes risks, and not only in its grotesque subject matter. The film has unmatched aesthetic ambitions, as waves of vibrant, hyper-stylized sounds and colors elevate the relentless bloodbath."
rotten, Pushes the Hollywood action movie to stratospheric new levels of incoherence.
rotten, I can honestly barely be bothered to remember what the point of the present-day part of the story even was.
fresh," The romance doesn't match the visual splendor, but no matter: The lushness is enough."
fresh," A slightly faster set-up, and slightly more drawn-out climax, would make this even better."
fresh," Dunham is a comedian of the Elaine May school; she's not as freakishly talented as that comparison might suggest, but there are moments in this film when Dunham very much resembles May's own daughter, the actress Jeannie Berlin."
fresh," A less violent, less successful movie that would have balanced the first film's kinetic energy had it been shown as Tarantino originally intended: as an uninterrupted whole."
fresh," If the last Muppet movie was Gremlins, this Muppet movie would definitely be Gremlins 2, The New Batch. "
fresh," Foster does succeed in drawing some of the best performances we've seen in a while from the central quartet, especially Roberts, who clearly relishes her role."
rotten," His personal insights are fascinating, but you need a good working knowledge of Israel's history since 1948 to place Avner's recollections into a wider context."
fresh, The Great Museum is an intriguing tribute to the dozens of unsung heroes who toil away to provide an environment where the public can come into contact with art and artifacts from times gone by.
rotten, The film doesn't deliver any frights or creepiness. The so-called shocking parts are revealed in the trailer. The rest feels as if moments have been stitched together to make a whole.
fresh," What his other movies have done summarily or languidly, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels does with some clear novice stumbles. It's creative and very clever. It's just not a classic."
fresh," ""Planet Earth"" might have made us tougher to impress, but ""Seasons"" has the advantage of its focus on a timeline, showing the gradual incursion of man into this earthly paradise."
fresh," At its best when keeping its action and characters grounded, this is a leaner, less-explosion-heavy comic book flick than most recent efforts, and thankfully absolves the sins of its much-maligned predecessor. "
fresh," Everything about The Wolfpack is extraordinary, beginning with the subjects of Crystal Moselle's mesmerizing documentary."
rotten, Dated and confused.
fresh," Peter Jackson's Battle of the Five Armies ends his Hobbit trilogy on a somewhat underwhelming note, but it's worth taking that final trip to his Middle-earth."
fresh," Its power comes from the slow, steady build to the execution of Perry Smith, the man half-responsible for the murders of a farming family of four, and what that death does to Capote."
rotten, The special effects simply thrust Ultraviolet in an Xbox 360 for action set-pieces that are kinetic and colorful but surprisingly unexciting. Do we really care if she dies when she's just going to be regenerated anyway?
rotten, The movie completely goes off the rails.
fresh," The details of Kim's cinematic obsession are vividly spelled out by filmmakers Ross Adam and Robert Cannan, illustrated with clips of Shin's North Korean movies and ample footage of the familiar, coordinated mass displays of patriotism."
rotten," Ms. Stone's character is bad, but sexy. The movie wants to be sexy, but it's mostly just bad."
rotten," The near-monochrome visuals, kitschy character design and some very glaring plot holes vie for attention in Cheung's highly stylised third feature."
rotten," What would ""The Pretty One"" be without Zoe Kazan's pixieish melancholy and offbeat comic timing? Not much."
fresh," Cinephiles seeking insight into Kubrick's personality and process will find plenty of it here, as Vitali spins stories of Stanley's mercurial temperament, technological expertise and devotion to his pets."
fresh," The scenes of brute survival - hunting for food, improvising shelter, making wind-and-snow masks out of sheets of birch bark - are vivid. The men are not."
rotten, Cast actors with a bit of box-office clout; hire a director smart enough to shoot each explosion so it can be shown multiple times from different angles; find a script with all the depth and complexities of a coloring book. And ``Action!''...
fresh, A first rate film with an outstanding cast...
rotten, Too bland a presentation to be remembered later on during Oscar time for the 2009 award.
fresh, An ode to the neighborhood pub. Makes the case that pubs are in Ireland are museums with Guinness on tap.
fresh, The Swedish thriller 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' miraculously causes the adjectives 'convoluted' and 'implausible' to become positive
fresh, Woody's Allen's period drama feels more like a stage play than a film - its claustrophobic atmosphere can be stifling. But Kate Winslet is a bonfire that burns through every scene.
rotten, Populaire ultimately feels too desperate to be a crowd pleaser to really satisfy as one.
fresh," With Friends with Kids, [Director Jennifer] Westfeldt has given us -- for the first time in a while -- a romantic comedy for adults."
rotten," Despite pulsating to a hot, hot, hot salsa beat, El Cantante is often a mess, mess, mess."
rotten," The film follows too many tangents, including film editing, sound and the purportedly evil effects of rock lyrics, to adequately consider any of them."
rotten, Pointless Pirates
fresh," A great monster chase movie, some cool gore, and Henstridge had a promising debut. Too bad it never went anywhere."
rotten," The Journey is an apocryphal drama about the Northern Irish peace process, and makes its subject look like a methodical tootle around the block by comparison."
rotten, Was the original novel ... as cheesy as this?
fresh, Extreme violence in inventive sci-fi actioner. 
rotten," The average Hollywood action picture is aimed at 12-year-olds of all ages, but Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg's feature-length come-on for Hasbro's much-loved toy series (and its spin-off cartoons, video games and comics) aims even lower."
fresh," If the setup is creaky, the payoff, when it arrives, is a thing to behold."
rotten," ...there's an undeniable fierceness and intelligence in Manyaka's lead performance. She's far from a polished actor, but there's real steel there."
rotten, The Spy Who Dumped Me is like if you put every Paul Feig movie into the blender with a steaming pile of shit. 
rotten," A scrubbed-clean fantasy, the story of privileged people living lives taken straight from catalogs."
rotten, Relatively innocuous but utterly unnecessary -- except from the standpoint of unbridled capitalism.
rotten," Didn't Judge realize that Extract, with its plastic setups and one-dimensional harpies, plays like Kevin Smith remaking a bad George Segal comedy from 1978?"
fresh," The film feels as glitzy and superficial as the fashion industry itself, a bauble in full regalia, and it's likely your interest in the documentary will depend largely on your prior interest in the subject matter."
rotten, A wedding movie that may have viewers rooting for divorce lawyers.
fresh," Nacho Vigalondo's giant-creature-run-amuck fantasy is a brilliantly bizarro satire of gender politics, featuring Anne Hathaway in a funny, fierce, fully committed performance that demands to be seen."
rotten, [It feels] like a late-night cable-news hack job.
rotten," The most startling thing about it is that anyone thought this story needed telling a third time -- and not just one anyone, but a group of them had to come to this crackpot conclusion. "
fresh," It doesn't confront church scandal-priestly crime; it stares into the spiritual void that has been left in its wake. What stares back is lurid, soulless and damned."
fresh, It's not just Joan's campiness -- her line readings take on an almost incantatory quality -- but the way the whole thing feels like a stealth therapy session for smart actors trapped in horse-opera stereotypes.
fresh, A modern morality play serving as a telling reminder of exactly how easily an American Dream can dissolve into a neverending dystopian nightmare.
rotten," It feels like Russell and Annie Mumolo, with whom he shares the story credit, never quite cracked Joy's personal journey to the point where it would be enough to carry the film on its own."
fresh," As the two women try to process their mixed-up feelings, the viewer too is thrown into confusion by the paradoxical nature of their parallel storylines, unsure how to determine what is real, and what is merely dream, fantasy or magic "
rotten, The first 40 minutes are the least bad.
fresh," Moves at its own pace, luring you in before delivering an ice-cold hammer-blow of an ending."
fresh," Combine the characters, the story, the message, and the acting, and it's easy to see why It's a Wonderful Life isn't just a holiday favorite, but a great movie by almost any standards."
rotten," It's like Fight Club without the tongue-in-cheek satire, cribbing from Gladiator, Braveheart, and every videogame that ever concluded a level with a giant boss battle."
rotten, Branagh's performance falls flat when compared with those of Peter Ustinov and David Suchet. Since he is in almost every scene it made the movie even less enjoyable than it could have been especially since most already know the oft-told story. 
fresh," Even though No Strings Attached is the sort of movie in which you know exactly how things will turn out five minutes into the story, it makes the predictable journey surprisingly fun and enjoyable."
fresh, ... it's an absolute delight.
fresh, This film is such a gem and more proof on why studios should be green-lighting more original ideas.
rotten, [Provides] dumbfounding sci-fi vistas in admirable quantity if not quite in creativity.
fresh," Yet another impressive technical accomplishment for Cuarón, Roma explores the filmmaker's memories of childhood in a truly immersive and vivid manner."
fresh," Good work for the sake of good work -- it delivers something I'll readily admit is enjoyable, but not easily embraceable."
fresh," ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is entertaining enough. I just wish it had not been longer than its much older sibling."
rotten," San Andreas is such a programmatic, by-the-numbers film, genre-savvy viewers could practically recite along with the script."

rotten," Hackford struggles to find an equivalency for Westlake's spare, hard-boiled prose."
fresh," Trace the blast pattern to its source and you see a causal chain leading all the way back to a ticking time bomb of errant masculinity, exposed for all its emptiness. "
rotten," ""Taken 2"" refashioned Bryan Mills in the image of Brosnan instead of Bronson. ""Taken 3"" works in a similarly bland, proficient groove. ""It ends here,"" says the poster. Let's hope so. We, and Neeson, have better things to do."
rotten, It never rings true because it bogs down in contrivances and heightened character quirks that emphasize sitcom caricatures over authentic family dynamics.
fresh," Güeros provides space for this type of dialogue (parallels of social criticisms) delivered through beautiful prose, colloquialisms, music and humor."
rotten, Billy Corben's glitzy documentary about the rise and demise of NY club lord Peter Gatien is studded with psychedelic images and audio that don't add much to the story -- except confusion.
rotten," The film tries to deliver a message about pacifism and being yourself to young kids, but the message it really delivers is that violence is OK as long as you have an excuse."
rotten," Dylan Dog works best when it has fun with P.I. conventions; when the monsters take over, it goes downhill."
fresh," Irritating as the throughline's lack of subtlety may be, it's still about the least worst thing you can say about a film that is unashamedly designed for the multiplex. "
fresh, Jake Gyllenhaal attains acting heights here that are not even hinted at in his earlier roles.
fresh," Four-hour visual stunner requires patience, maturity."
fresh, Not every movie needs to be an instant classic. Sometimes all you need is a pleasant diversion. Hopefully we won't have to wait another decade for Edgerton's third feature.
fresh, This is a decidedly lightweight film but well made and one that has occasionally very funny gags.
fresh," In this slick, beautiful film about Edward R. Murrow and his clashes with Joseph McCarthy, the senator appears as his sleazy self and reminds us why Ann Colter is an idiot."
fresh," Instead of contrived urgency, there's unpressured whimsy, and the movie exists as pure charm, expressed in fantastical imagery. And then there are the songs."
fresh," Cate the Great once again imbues the Queen with her captivating mix of steely strength, regal dignity, take-no-crap toughness, and intimate vulnerability."
fresh," There is such a thing as a passionate, headlong phony, and you'll meet her in Author: The JT LeRoy Story."
fresh," Anchored by dry humor and purposefully understated performances, Lonesome Jim steadily builds in charm as it progresses."
rotten," Hamilton's story is a human one with spiritual underpinnings, yet to the detriment of the inherent drama, the filmmaker tells it the other way around. "
rotten," Eventually, you realize the movie isn't comprised of much more than premise, greeting-card wisdom and coincidences, and its two hours start to grow long."
rotten, What happened to the good old fashioned insane killer?
rotten," ...I couldn't help but think as I was watching it how much greater the impact would have been, had we been following real immigrant workers in this situation through the lens of a documentary."
rotten, A special kind of botched sci-fi film experiment.
fresh," Whether it's memoir or personalized fiction, Ginger & Rosa displays a shrewd understanding of late adolescence-a time when every emotional slight lands like an atom bomb."
rotten," I'll just say that Buscemi, who also directed and co-wrote, knows a lot about making movies but little about journalism."
rotten," It'd be a tragedy if it weren't so richly absurd, but it would also make for better comedy if the joke weren't on us. The Informant! laughs so long and hard that it forgets to check whether we're laughing along."
rotten," The movie ends as it started, with Marie in a carriage, unaware of the fate we know awaits her. It's the last in a long line of things the movie neither shows or tells us."
fresh," Alternately outrageous and sweet, it may not be quite as filling as a nice piece of pie, but it's certainly as tasty."
rotten, Andy Serkis is failed by not having pockets as deep as Disney to create the photorealistic imagery that is truly needed to make this work and could have used a rewrite of the script
fresh, Strikes a mighty blow to the summer blockbuster season and will charge up audiences just like the first 'Iron Man.'
rotten," By the time the boys face battle with 'thinking machine' Korrock in another dimension, it's difficult to remain invested, although hallucinogens would probably aid immensely."
fresh," Traffic Stop's strength, as with all great docs, lies in its capacity to instill empathy in the viewer, placing them in the middle of a situation they'd likely have little occasion to experience in their lives."
rotten," The short film is a bright, forgettable throwaway, even though its anti-bullying message is timely."
rotten," A gargantuan mess of a film, which substitutes special effects for story and has not a single redeeming moment in its two hour plus running time."
fresh," As outlandish as the central character is, he uncovers some biting truths that no comedy writer could invent any better."
fresh," Yes, it's the peculiarly heartwarming tale of a man who becomes a better partner thanks to an alien invasion, but it also has an enormous body count and a dimly optimistic view of humanity. Still, you won't see anything else quite like it this year."
fresh, The movie works best when the action is at 'The Farm' and the recruits are learning what it takes to play spy.
rotten," It'll be way too cloying for most - but the, ahem, bee's knees for sugar fiends. Probably best enjoyed with a glass of Chardonnay and your cynicism on hold."
rotten," If Adam and Eve had been burdened with the same lack of chemistry between Scarlett Johansson and Hugh Jackman, the human race would have died aborning."
rotten," Loverboy, the shaky second feature directed by Kevin Bacon, stars Kyra Sedgwick as a single mother whose possessive instinct runs amok."
rotten," Goblet is really just a glorified, 157-minute teaser trailer, an empty epic of proportions that truly stagger."
fresh," There's fascinating stories here and it is, at a meta level, almost heartbreaking, almost infuriating that we know that this is a slice of our population that lives this way and doesn't seem to have any other options. "
fresh," If convolution where compliments, Anonymous would be one highly flattered film."
rotten," ""Green Book"" is a feel-good movie, with strong performances and a generous spirit. But maybe this isn't the time to feel good."
rotten," The pleasingly acerbic Stiles gives it her all, and if the script had had one-tenth the zest of the now-classic ""AtomicShakespeare"" episode of the TV series ""Moonlighting"" she might have managed to make something of the vehicle."
rotten," It's billed as a 'Hitchcockian thriller,' but frankly I see nothing either Hitchcockian nor thrilling this same-old Gallic tale..."
fresh," It requires a lot of exposition but it's well done and once complete, this gloriously animated, musically lovely and supremely Mexican visual feast flies along."
fresh," The general bleakness of the film, its themes and the author's youthful anger could not be erased with digital technology."
rotten," It does what it does reasonably well with a sense of exploitative glee, but it's also immediately forgettable."
rotten," Reuniting, or really, introducing, the gang is a gimmick. It's also self-destructive-cramming in all these characters chokes up the plot, and who watches a Step Up for the plot? "
rotten," Still, while his first feature may be gorgeous, the characters in this rural family drama prove so amorphous that their struggles engender detachment instead of empathy."
fresh," Sweet romantic comedy-fantasy has some language, sex. "
fresh, [Harry Potter] is now the lone beacon of despair for children in an increasingly pandering and brainless cinematic landscape; a Grimm tale that should satisfy the darker whims of imaginative children.
fresh," Beautiful, heartfelt, its ambition matched by its execution. The trilogy ends on a triumphant, heart-swelling high."
fresh," Capping a summer movie season when humanity was practically extinct every other weekend, Wright gives Armageddon a funnier name than even This Is the End did."
rotten," Bad Words wants so desperately to be funny, there isn't much time left to make any logic out of the story. "
fresh," Nothing earthshaking, but a pretty scary night out..."
fresh," A nice gesture, but in the sequel I'd like to see these refined rednecks really shaken out of their comfort zone. How about taking these folks north of the Mason-Dixon Line to see how the other half of the country lives before they miss out on the 21st C."
fresh," This remains a taut, haunting ride thanks to solid writing and directing by Zack Whedon (Joss and Jed's younger brother) and a strong, sympathetic performance by Paul."
rotten," Rings false, belittling instead of honoring its sensitive subject with its twinkly score, kid-glove nobility and cloying payoffs. [Blu-ray]"
fresh," [Little Girl Blue shows] how Joplin revelled in her stage persona yet struggled with life: a recipe for triumph then tragedy, here given its punchy and desperately poignant due."
rotten, Director Xavier Gens admirably tries his best with the material but he is failed by a sub-par script by Skip Woods.
rotten, Peaches Geldof would probably love it. And film reviews don't get any more depressing than that.
fresh," The perils of appearing on reality television are well-rehearsed by now, but Matteo Garrone must be the first filmmaker to address the perils of not appearing on it."
fresh, The culture's caught up to Gilliam. Everybody's doing Orwell now. But Gilliam's appropriation feels both aptly skeptical and unfashionably utopian.
fresh," Zootopia is a reminder of just how beautiful animated films can be. Holy cow, this thing is almost hallucinatory."
fresh, Expect well-deserved Oscar nominations for both Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren.
rotten, A movie that's supposed to inspire winds up being irritating instead.
rotten," Utterly abysmal, entirely laugh-free and hideously embarrassing."
fresh," As far as it goes, Eddie: The Sleepwalking Cannibal is a well-paced and calibrated blend of juicy gore and low-key comedy."
fresh," It does remain a challenge to immerse yourself and invest in the tale at hand, such is the pure absurdity of it all."
fresh," ""Wake in Fright"" is a monster movie, and the monster is us."
fresh," Jack Reacher is trash, but since when is that a bad thing? If this should kick off a franchise, there are far worse signatures than a knowing sense of humour. It might just be what's missing from all those other deathly grim series out there."
rotten, Meandering and confusing.
rotten," no matter how much Campbell fans may like the amiably daft and cheesy My Name Is Bruce, they would probably prefer to be liking it a little more"
fresh, What really makes The Eyes of My Mother so unsettling is the innocence that Kika Magalhaes brings to the role of Francesca.

fresh, Don't call it a comeback because Woody Harrelson never went away! This film that will remind everyone how good of an actor he is.
rotten, Well-made but ultimately dull. 
rotten," It has a great cast, but a failed premise and a weak script work. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten, This movie is more like a B-grade comic book adaptation than the A-list production it should have been.
rotten, Brosnan's seductive charm outshines the dull script.
fresh," This may be a retrograde adolescent wish-fulfilment fantasy, sadistic and violent, but it's also slickly made and has real satirical bite."
rotten," There is no vitality in the story or the images on screen. Everything is explained through dialogue and the end result is, at best, decent. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten," Wow, what a massive cluster...um...you know... the film is. This would-be player tried her best to be ready, but sometimes - sorry, Hamlet - the readiness isn't all."
rotten," Where I should have been immersed in the darkly tinged mood of the story, I felt more like an observer to a film production process of making the film."
rotten," The plot takes forever to get rolling, and the movie is hamstrung by numerous tourism sequences (from the Forbidden City to the Great Wall) facilitated by the state-run China Film Group."
rotten, Trades in vital game info to squeeze in as much acrobatics and fighting sequences as possible. Bartkowiak shouldn't have taken the first part of the title so literally. 
rotten, Anyone going to a PG-13 horror film called Blood and Chocolate thinking that it's going to be good has serious reality issues.
rotten," A disappointing revisit to Wonderland which, despite its best efforts, fails to make a lasting impression."
rotten," The bothersome and irritating thing about the way The Midwife is written is that we keep hearing story after story about the shared history between Claire and Béatrice, but we never get a solid idea of what that history was."
rotten," In addition to all the obvious things that are disgusting about this movie, I Spit on Your Grave is trying to get us to hate each other. Hate it instead. It makes more sense and the hatred is much more deserved."
rotten," An infinite trailer that is all effects, no affect."
rotten, There is so little political depth and dramatic tension in the leaden script that the subversive aspect of Ritchie and Pinto's platonic partnership is almost negligible.
fresh," But for all its shocking imagery, IT is more successful as a coming-of-age story-aided by a talented cast of unknowns-with the monster serving as a stand-in for our collective loss of innocence."
rotten, You don't even have to be familiar with the first movie made from the Hitman title (or even remember that there was one) to judge this reboot
fresh, Training dragons never looked more fun.
rotten, A disappointing film because it simply doesn't live up to the enormity of its subject matter; it doesn't engage us but batters us into submission.
rotten, A British version of those old Hollywood films about bigotry that always decried how terrible it used to be in the South.
rotten," In the end, as one unconvincing plot twist follows another, The Boxer can't sustain the initial interest it aroused."
fresh," A good, solid, enjoyable animated film for all ages."
fresh, That the whole thing clocks in north of two hours is nearly unforgivable. But it's all so frivolous and light in touch that it still manages to be fun.
rotten, Would that the film were a tenth as deliciously bad as its title.
rotten, The effect is often soporific.
rotten," If you don't want to view an hour-and-a-half long catfight, Jawbreaker is a definite no."
fresh, The most refreshing thing about Puzzle is that it's an adult movie about characters and their low-key circumstances.
fresh, This action-thriller is so predictable that you probably could outline the plot after watching a 30-second TV spot. But it's so entertaining you won't budge from your seat until the final bullet has flown.
rotten," Disappointing drama that's let down by a plodding script, painfully slow pacing, a number of emotional misfires and an atrocious child performance."
fresh," It's a strong film, complex in many ways, and seems to me to come from a genuinely stricken conscience. But in its formal probity, Lebanon turns into a moral dodge."
fresh, Batman has begun to exhibit more of the qualities Burton finds so interesting.
fresh," It's the rare holiday movie that manages to entertain the kid in all of us, without forgetting that grownups love the Grinch, too."
rotten," ""This allegedly supernatural horror movie takes so much time getting to the actual ""horror"" elements - all in the name of supposed character and story ""progression"" - that it may bore even the most easily frightened of audiences to tears."""
rotten," John Waters' most bizarre work is also his worst, a nonsensical palette of disgusting characters, bad acting, a baffling plot, and just plain bad taste."
rotten," Undeniably bad, but sort of a nice try. [Blu-ray]"
fresh, The Son's Room is a triumph of gentility that earns its moments of pathos.
rotten," Though it gains traction toward the end, viewers may finally feel puzzled or indifferent. You expect a bit more from the end of the world."
fresh, Kilmer as the Lizard King!
fresh, It's a measure of the movie's success that one oscillates between two despairs -- noting the abject failure of the system and the utter futility of revolt.
rotten," It's all a bit like a classic-rock tribute concert, or playing with all your action figures at once, or maybe ""Cannonball Run,"" with the strained buddy-buddy back-and-forth."
rotten," If you know your muscle cars and supercars and don't care too much about other people, the movie will be your bottle of Yahoo, so pardon the rest of us if we look on these self-absorbed camshaft brats and wish them a speedy flat tire."
rotten, It's sad that the film could not live up to Dominic Cooper's epic performance(s). The flick had such a made-for-TV feel containing massive plot holes and a cheesy romance.
rotten, The film version of Khaled Hosseini's novel is so portentously sincere that you may feel like a cretin for embracing it with anything less than a full heart.
fresh," ...heartfelt humanism once again enlivens the filmmaker's craft, yet this time around the film seems quieter, more charming and eccentric than awing."
rotten," Money Monster doesn't fully come alive on screen. It tries too hard to make a statement, losing sight of the people amid the politics."
fresh," ""Day of the Soldado"" is at its best when it sticks to its own raw brand of truth."
rotten," The latest film is extremely noisy, features some fine stunt driving, particularly in its opening sequence, but it's dramatically a bit of a dribbler. I'm still trying to figure out the relationship between the opening of the film and the ending."
rotten, The real problem with Rampage is that it fails to really commit. It should have been either considerably less dumb or a LOT dumber. 
rotten," Remember the wise old saying about the journey being more important than the destination? Spurlock no doubt prays you do, because from the outset of his search-and-destroy gimmick, the journey is the only authentic part."
fresh," To say that they don't make movies like this anymore -- splendidly, quietly angry in a folksy, old-fashioned kind of way -- is to prove its point..."
rotten, [A] training-bra of a flick designed to indoctrinate tweens with the estrogen-drenched sappiness of 'women's pop culture'...
rotten, an exercise in empty histrionics. 
rotten," Motors along at such a slow pace it hardly earns its moniker of 'thriller,' often keeping any real tension at an aggravating minimum."
rotten," Feels like a remake of the first one, with the same character struggles and plot points we've come to expect"
fresh," Varela in this way modifies the equation, we no longer look for the pantheon but rather one very attractive types for being eccentric and extravagant alike. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten," Burton lets his film putter along in middle gear, provoking neither riotous laughter nor emotional immersion."
rotten," What, you expected something different from the man behind the Resident Evil series?"
fresh, A vivid reworking of Daniel Woodrell's novel that brings the book's conflicted heroine to searing life in a piece of unhurried filmmaking too rarely seen these days.
rotten," ... [Russell] bullshits his way through the narrative, basically, giving his stellar cast plenty of room to improvise at length but in the end coming off as an indulgent storyteller unable to self-edit."
fresh," Manolo might be a hard sell to moviegoers who aren't already interested, but for fashion enthusiasts, it's an enjoyable confection."
rotten," You're left with stilted dialogue and dark, underlit sets."
fresh, There's no doubting the film's commitment to a compassionate understanding of the complexities of the human heart.
fresh," A punishing viewing experience, but a uniquely vile sit that rewards the brave with exemplary technical credits, a sure pace in the early going, and the sight of McConaughey reacquainting himself with excellence. "
fresh, A beguiling cinematic journey through identity formation in Latin America.
fresh," Anne Dorval, Antoine Olivier Pilon and Suzanne Clément give scary-good performances."
rotten," Let's not mince words. As a kickoff to a proposed new series of films, dubbed the ""Dark Universe""... The Mummy is a very bad movie."
fresh, [Sudeikis is] fast and funny and Headland's willingness to tackle the unromantic aspects of the rom-com lends a sophistication you don't find in more anodyne examples.
fresh," If given the chance, this is not to be missed on the big screen."
fresh," In the next election, can I just vote Disney?"
rotten," Beautifully photographed, impeccably produced and wonderfully acted, but it offers no surprises..."
fresh," Hey, if you want to see Kevin Hart screeching like a mad-man and late-period Ice Cube gleefully giving shout-outs to his song titles through dialogue (as I often do), this is the place to get it."
rotten, The movie flirts with a great darkness about disillusionment and self-loathing even as it races around spinning comedic plates. Too bad the filmmakers lose their nerve by film's end.
rotten, Structurally unsound and way too long.
fresh," The deadpan irony and seemingly dispassionate air of Finnish director Aki Kaurismäki's movies certainly aren't for everyone, but they are a taste worth acquiring."
fresh," An earnest, thoughtful documentary."
rotten," Isn't a heartbreaking misfire, but it's not a picture that's thinking clear enough."
rotten," Watching producer-turned-director George Isaac's debut you can't help feeling that somewhere, lying lost on a cutting room floor, there might be a better movie. "
fresh," A breathtakingly beautiful film, dripping in atmosphere and mood and a quiet, understated dread that permeates every frame of the story."
fresh," As a burlesque of parental angst and sex panic, ""Blockers"" possesses sharply observed moments of inspired lunacy."
rotten," Sharks have it bad enough as endangered, misunderstood predators with a terrible public relations image without seeing their serial-killing stardom drowned out by hammy acting and torture-porn villainy."
fresh," Fortunately, Mr. Wong has made the perilous journey into a new language without sacrificing his artistic soul and very personal visual style."
rotten," Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines unfolds as a thrilling piece of entertainment, but it has a third act and ending that don't work and shouldn't ever work."
rotten," More than anything else, Leconte's bland chocolate-box romance resembles a film like The Notebook or The Lucky One, with its thwarted romance, chaste lack-of-sexuality and thin characters. "
fresh," It's as good as it needs to be to justify its place in the Indiana Jones canon, and that should be enough."
fresh, An astonishing full-throttle action movie that proves Miller may have taught those other directors everything they know - but he didn't teach them everything he knows.
rotten," This time out, both the words and the pictures are surprisingly flaccid, largely due to Gerald DiPego's literate but hopelessly contrived screenplay and direction that lacks Schepisi's usual snap."
rotten," Southside With You, while sweet and never less than reverent with its subjects, is hardly one of the great on-screen romances. It's also remarkably devoid of tension."
rotten," Money Monster's timing couldn't be much better. But this Wall Street satire could be and should be, with a promising setup betrayed by absurd twists and a conventional resolution so tidy it wreaks of studio meddling."
fresh," If only they'd spent the cash on a bad guy with stature, instead of taking that phrase, ""the banality of evil,"" so literally. Playing this Game might have been even more fun."
fresh, Serebrennikov deploys ornery irony in this scathing critique of a self-radicalized fundamentalist and local unbelievers.
rotten, There must be better material out there for [Paula Patton] somewhere.
rotten," The proceedings of Living In The Age Of Airplanes overall are enjoyable, but there are some surprising omissions from aviation history. "
rotten," When the film slows down enough for the dialogue to sink in, we realize that the story, such as it is, has been cobbled together from all previousStar Wars films combined."
rotten," Watching Depp in The Black Pearl was like discovering a new acting continent. Watching him here is like returning to a warm, familiar place - nice and all, not exciting"
rotten," An Australian thriller that's never quite as clever or original as it seems to think...as a movie, it's decidedly unthrilling."
fresh," Tucker and Dale vs Evil, much like the titular characters, is daft and doesn't much care for subtlety, but smart horror fans will laugh their way through this well-acted, subversive horror-comedy."
rotten," Bynes [is] appealing as usual, but not given much room in the script here to stretch her comedic chops."
rotten," You're likely to leave this movie wondering what you've just watched, as if you've been abused worse than the poor kidnapped girl."
rotten," An entirely laugh-free 83 minutes, spent in the company of irritating characters."
rotten, Entertaining but underwhelming.
fresh," ""Jab Tak Hai Jaan"" serves as a fitting tribute to the career of Chopra."
rotten," After a while, even Ayer's wildest stylistic choices settle down into DC Films' house style: the muted tones and industrial black/blue that Zack Snyder used to build America's visually dullest franchise of the moment."
rotten," Without much else beyond its 3-D design going for it, this adventure grows old very fast."
fresh," ""Wolff's humor and lucidity was one of the highest points of Guadalajara 2018""."
rotten," 'Do you know what I hate about the Americans? Everything.' The fifth 'Die Hard' movie offers no evidence to dispute this Russian villain's opinion, as arrogant John McClane does more damage to the former Soviet republic than a hailstorm of meteorites."
rotten, Contemplative but pretentious drama about Lincoln's boyhood.
rotten, ...this could very well be the premise for an off-the-wall new sitcom...
fresh," Pacino doesn't upstage Farrell, but there's the sense he's daring him to keep up, and Farrell does. Their scenes together crackle."
rotten," Instantly forgettable but inoffensive fluff... you know, for kids. And 'inoffensive' is better than can be said for many movies aimed at children."
rotten," It's no fun watching an innocent child suffer so much, just so we can be entertained by a 'Boo!'"
rotten, An intriguing and muddled relationship between three brilliant artists is downgraded into a tedious and lurid art-world soap opera full of convoluted love triangles.
fresh," Chandor knows his stock market and brokerage houses but the staging and reliance on unending dialogue ""scenes"" cries out stage play. "
rotten," A bad remake with zero innovations, almost replicating every frame in a poor manner and bad comedic timming. [Full review in Spanish]"

fresh," A great horror film without a doubt, but fans of the genre will expect more from it. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten," At least with the Jackass films you could sense the crew was having fun, and just along for the ride. Here, much like the broken down and poorly constructed roller coasters on display, Action Point never works."
fresh," Kurosawa definitely has a strong visual style and a knack for spinning engrossing, if not bizarre, stories that cross the genre divide."
rotten," ""Daddy's Home"" is a movie with a one-joke premise: Will Ferrell, he's a pincushion of punishment. Make him screech. Watch him squirm."
fresh," A passionate, full-blooded film."
rotten, A wildly scattershot comedy filled with bright moments that never cohere.
fresh, Involving coming-of-age drama disguised as a psychological thriller.
rotten, Castellitto must have been aiming for a story of redemption here. All he achieves is melodrama.
rotten," While there are fine, restrained moments exploring faith as both comfort and struggle, there's almost no way to portray a vision of Heaven literally that doesn't feel like somebody's telling us exactly what he thinks we want to hear."
fresh," Predictable but utterly engaging, 27 Dresses will likely be remembered as the film that made Katherine Heigl an A-list star."
fresh, Something original in the romantic comedy genre. [full review Spanish]
rotten, The film's problem is that it is almost an embittered celebration of exhaustion.
fresh," It operates on a different level, one that values the transformation over any kind of tangible reward."
rotten, ...there does reach a point wherein Mosley's efforts at prolonging the running time results in elements of desperate nature...
fresh," Southside With You doesn't need to preach, shout or wave its racial bona fides like a battle-worn banner. Instead, it embraces us, conspiratorially acknowledging a shared understanding that change requires fighting for hope and love in every moment."
rotten, [Gervasi's] Hitchcock goes only a step beyond caricature.
fresh," A marvelous slice of lo-fi whimsy about two duffers, longtime acquaintances in the gray zone between middle age and old age, who up and travel from Kentucky to the Land of Fire and Ice."
fresh," Though the drama is over 10 years old, it's pretty relevant for our #MeToo era."
fresh, It's equal parts tragic and hilarious and is very self-aware of the story it's telling. They milk every aspect of it and leave you wanting more.
fresh," A film of hypnotic urgency, a cautionary tale so rich and smart it will stand up to repeated viewings."
rotten, Director Steven Shill and the doltish dialogue don't do much to diminish the film's overt homophobia and misogyny.
fresh," For its dramatic simplicity, the film packs a hefty punch, exploring the bonds of trust that are tested to their limit in the face of the law."
fresh, A valuable look at an important slice of recent history.
fresh, You don't need to know or care about the skateboarding culture to enjoy this free-wheeling ride through a dog-eared section of '70s-era Los Angeles.
fresh," That the project is not only a success but one of 2010′s best films is a testament to Fincher's talent as a director and his seemingly perennial ability to surround himself with incredibly astute, like-minded collaborators."
fresh," ""Risk"" makes a case that character is stronger than idealism or ideology - that who you are will always trump what you hope to achieve."
fresh, Inherently good fun and a more than worthy trip to the cinema!
rotten, Not very convincing or funny.
fresh," Loveling relies on the charm of its chaotic central family (an overweight son who insists on carrying a giant tuba around with him, for example) and the warmth of Teles to seduce and dazzle audiences into submission."
fresh," Throw in an impressive supporting cast that includes Jennifer Connolly, Mahershala Ali, Jack Earle Hayley and Michelle Rodriguez and the result is an absorbing, entertaining rollercoaster ride that - fingers-crossed - may allow Alita to fight another day."
fresh," Carole and Delphine luxuriate in each other's company. It's a symbiotic relationship, which combines a sexual awakening for Carole and a political awakening for Delphine."
fresh," It's an eye-popping, involving summer movie that manages to layer thoughtful substance with the lively action."
rotten, This is an average movie that's chock-full of New-Age-y self help. And not much else.
rotten," The kind of thing you give to Gary Busey, not the Oscar-nominated star of 'The Grey' (a masterpiece)."
fresh," Effectively employs iconic Woodstock imagery not to regenerate a numbing sense of mass nostalgia but rather as a minimalist backdrop against which to amplify the anguished, intimate ordeal of a frustrated individual who wasn't even there."
rotten, You know you're not worth saving when the House of Mouse gives up on you. 
rotten," Despite crafting a consistently engaging film, the director doesn't present the full scope of Sixto Rodriguez's life."
fresh," There is nothing like experiencing this fabulous, larger-than-life, groundbreaking movie where it was meant to be experienced. And in 3D!"
fresh," Ross has given us something valuable: a portrait of a small, overlooked section of America, presented without judgment."
rotten," Jackman throws himself into the role, while little Levi Miller, although serviceable, doesn't quite get the room to show signs of being the boy who eventually comes to be Peter Pan - a factor that only serves to pull down the film further."
fresh," You, Me & Dupree is best when Wilson is on-screen, mucking around with exquisite deadbeat timing, baring his all -- or his almost -- as the situation demands."
fresh," Since The Artist can't speak for itself, let me sing its praises instead."
rotten," ""What is Morgan?"" the film's marketing campaign has been asking for weeks. Turns out, Morgan is just another sci-fi film that's only engineered to disappoint."

fresh, Jim Carrey gets the chance to shine in funny and serious scenes as he cavorts through 'Bruce Almighty'-- and he's got the power to do both.
rotten, Dim the lights and light up the bong.
fresh," Margarethe Von Trotta's many personal connections to Ingmar Bergman lend a fresh, distinctive flavour to Searching For Ingmar Bergman."
rotten," Spectacle alone is no longer enough to satisfy, and without a coherent story to support it, The Great Wall falls flat."
rotten," Tower indeed is living a magnificent life, which Tenaglia nearly suffocates in a creaky ""Citizen Kane""-style telling ..."
rotten, The unsure approach to rich material (based on a story about a newspaper's homophobic coverage of a drowned man) mixes the sexy and grotesque - and cancels each other's good parts out.
fresh," Itinerant crooks or satanists? This bizarre import has the feel of a fever dream. Characters, most especially the eponymous gardener, float through the narrative as if in a Dr. Caligari-induced haze. "
rotten," It's episodic, not very funny and the redemptive ending feels far too forced."
fresh," The Guest borrows from other genre pictures with such intelligence and clarity of purpose, it manages to feel fresh, exciting."
fresh," Spurlock balances the stories of his characters with the larger context, showing us that each of the attendees has a story and that Comic-Con is a place where stories and characters always matter."
rotten, A skin-deep portrait of a story so interesting it feels like you could burrow into it for years.
rotten," The satire on globalism and downsizing is also as old as the Clinton administration, but that doesn't stop director David Dobkin from selling it like fresh goods."
fresh," Demy is best known stateside for his wondrous musical The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, but some consider this, his debut feature, to be his best work."
rotten," By the end, you're reminded, once again, why there are so many Michael Mann imitators but so few who are able to burn his influence into something memorable."
rotten," ...an alarmist, cautionary tale that suggests a division more flagrantly than has yet been heretofore evident in films."
rotten," A dull, formulaic theme-park ride whose only purpose is to make more pots of money."
fresh, Director Jennifer Kent's first outing as a horror director is a downright flawless effort...
rotten," A cumbersome and trite ""dangerous rise of technology"" story that fails to engage."
fresh," The underlying dark themes of death and suicide are leavened with sweetness, love, humor, and even hope."
rotten," The execution almost overcomes the thinking in ""Think Like a Man."" Almost."
rotten," This sixth installment, by far the worst in the series, is bland and deadening."
fresh," By the time four little girls teach a dorky guy to dance to (the original) ""Let's Hear It for the Boy"" I was a gelatinous blob of pure affection. Bring on ""Flashdance"" 2.0."
rotten," It's still a mediocre rehearsal of genre conventions, and somewhat pointless ... but at least it's coherent?"
rotten," ""Jupiter Ascending"" is a planet-sized dud."
fresh, Eddie the Eagle is infectious. 
fresh," Final Destination 2 repeats just about everything from the first installment, only with tighter plotting and more enjoyable chills."
rotten," Unwanted and unnecessary as few other sequels have been, Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween betrays any goodwill fostered by the surprisingly delightful 2015 film, simply crashing and burning. "
fresh," The mood is akin to Ingmar Bergman's Persona or Roman Polanski's Repulsion. So don't watch expecting a barrel of laughs. You might, though, detect hints of dark comedy."
rotten," Anything goes, which may make all this great fun for the hallucinogenically inclined, but since nothing in these sequences has any lasting consequences, suspense is difficult to amplify."
rotten," This ""comedy"" might be the Worst Movie Ever Seen, even with the aftershock of the Wayans Bros' Dance Flick still lingering."
fresh," It's good to see Martin Scorsese back among the bad guys again, knocking heads, spraying bullets, sloshing through the bloody puddles of their conflicted Catholicism."
rotten," Who else but Sartre-reading, Fellini-watching wannabe-sophisticated 15-year-olds will find this film intriguing?"
rotten, An uneasy mixture of raucous Will Ferrell farce and kid-friendly Disney Channel teen teleflick that never gels.
fresh," An intellectual exercise in metaphysical romance -- Ghost for art-house audiences. But what it gains from structural analysis, it loses in emotional impact."
rotten, Ponderous direction cripples Tatum with crying like a newborn. Belongs in the dead letter bin.
rotten, Easily amongst the seven or eight best Hollywood productions ever made about a woman contemplating whether or not to sign a dominant/submissive contract.
rotten," Sadly, the promised zings and arrows never fly in ""Zoolander 2,"" which with the exception of a mildly clever opening sequence, steadfastly avoids pointed satire in an attempt simply to cash in, tread water and peace out."
fresh," Couples Retreat is a comedy/drama mix, but it's mostly the comedy parts that work."
rotten," On their own, these are all people you'd gladly fork over $10 to watch. Unfortunately, together, in this frenetic, plate-spinning, south-of-the-border caper, they all look a bit lost."
rotten, A bit on the slow side.
rotten," There is nothing here to justify a sequel, other than the merchandising revenue. What they have given us is a limp, over-stuffed film that lacks class."
fresh, You can say this: It is never boring.
rotten," The Guilt Trip may have sounded funnier on paper, but the film doesn't give you a lot to laugh about. "
rotten," Mature sex addiction dramedy has some highs, but also lows."
fresh," The camera does nothing but flatter [Isabelle Huppert], and deservedly so."
rotten," It's just a jumped-up midnight movie that thinks ""stuff jumping out at you and making loud noises"" equals horror and ""perfect human being impervious to everything"" equals hero."
rotten, The film requires a lot of perseverance to sit through and with very little pay off at the end
fresh," Hopefully, this loving adaptation will allow a new generation to discover this masterpiece."
fresh," You may not learn much about Alejandro Jodorowsky's actual childhood after watching this affecting film. You will see how the situation of his growing up influenced everything else in his life, however. "
rotten," It's hard to know what to make of a film such as this, with its implicit message that it takes men to empower women in sports."
fresh, It's sursmurfingly not-bad.
rotten," How does it end? With a headache, of course, from all those cheering children."
fresh," It is quite simply one of the craziest stories ever told, made all the crazier by the fact that it's true. Or at least some version of it is true."
fresh," You don't have to agree with the politics of it to be impressed by the civility of the discourse, and that's something so sorely lacking today that it seems almost quaint. What a shame."
fresh," Timothy Spall inhabits the role so completely he disappears within in it, a trick of the light."
fresh," Not since Iron Man has a superhero movie surprised and delighted like Doctor Strange, after eight years of Marvel glut and DC rebuttals in-between."
fresh," The tight, focused script ensures that the crazier aspects of the film aren't superfluous and don't distract from the characters' main quest. It's also jam-packed full of hilarious jokes."
fresh," A tense and well narrated film, that's always something to be thankful of... [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten," With the honourable exception of a film-saving Byung-sik, the characters are too unpleasant and two-dimensional to keep it together."
rotten," A Late Quartet is slow, talky, and a bit too knowing and explicit."
rotten, Shot after shot of swaying Marram grass manipulatively cut to the elfin hymns of Sigur Rós is a poor substitute for thorough investigatory fieldwork.
rotten, A truly lightweight forgettable piece of fluff which will barely make a blip either in the cinemas or on video.
fresh," Ashes is joyous and uplifting, full of spirit, memorable athletes (including Olympian Adrien Niyonshuti) and remarkable achievements, both big and small."
fresh," A deeply humane film, as well as a quietly hilarious one."
rotten, A preposterous faux-feminist manifesto that blames the woes of the modern day female on her historical disconnectedness.
rotten," Writer-director Wayne Kramer insists on trying to tell us all the way through what we should feel. Yet, by the end, it's not clear what he's trying to say: are U.S. immigration laws unfair, unnecessary or badly enforced?"
fresh," Becomes a little numbing. Until then, however-and breaking points will vary-it feels like the most visually dazzling film of the fest"
rotten," Films such as The Best Man and The Wood have gone over this terrain before, with considerably more style and humor."
fresh, Michael Powell's Peeping Tom is the best movie ever made about the voyeuristic allure of making and watching movies.
fresh," A comic clash of stereotypical Red State and Blue State culture, but with a wish-fulfillment Hollywood ending in which 'Fockerization' triumphs..."
fresh," ""Tomboy"" is tender and affectionate."
rotten," A sleazy, uninspired, pathetically unfunny sex farce."
fresh, Frank body image docu advocates acceptance. 
rotten, It doesn't take a private eye with a heart of felt to figure out that a witless comedy with poorly executed ideas and lazy use of gross-out humor will end up DOA.
rotten," Even though it's chick-flicky with men who are either girly men or brutish clods, Goodwin and Krasinsky (in the Tony Randall role) give good performances."
fresh," Scrappily made as if tossed off on a mere lark, bending genre and tone at will, Diamantino feels a goof, piqued and liberated-for better or for worse."
fresh," For all its potential pitfalls, The DUFF manages to keep its head above water, thanks to Whitman, Amell, and a willingness to engage with teen-movie clichés in a relatively thoughtful way."
rotten," Crowe softens just about everything, as if he didn't want to hurt the feelings of anyone he knew back then."
fresh," Forges a penetrating, enriching human connection between the viewer and the subject."
rotten, The pace is grueling...as the many sword fighting sequences clang on and on. Even battling gigantic tentacles becomes a yawner after the 45th pirate is squeezed.
fresh," The film proceeds at Detective Cristi's pace, stopping and starting, hiding and emerging, scanning and staring, as the languid camera surveys the dismal neighborhoods with undisguised ennui."
fresh," Fascinating despite itself. Which every way you fall, this will provoke a strong reaction."
fresh," In The General, director John Boorman is back in top form."
rotten," Never really [delivers] the sun-in-your-face, salt-in-your-hair, sandy-cocky thrill of surfing or surf culture."
rotten, An efficient time-passer at least until the plot starts obsessing over the fate of the family dog.
fresh, richly-detailed British costume drama
rotten," ""Left Behind"" takes the end of the world and turns it not into a nightmare, but a nice long nap."
rotten," Australian television star Stapleton, despite his best efforts, never summons the intensity that Gerard Butler so effortlessly exuded in the previous film."
fresh," The reward will be insights into sports and celebrity, fame and sexual status, and of course, and especially, race."
fresh," The movie doesn't cop out into cheap melodrama, never turning the hijackers into cardboard villains and never glorifying one passenger or crew member over the others."
fresh," Sorry Angel has all the restless energy of 120 BPM, even if it is considerably more aimless."
fresh, [It] aspires to a poetry about barbarism that will not let us forget.
fresh," It may not necessarily be flawless in its execution, but Scarecrows is a pretty admirable filmmaking achievement in many ways. As far as first-time features go, director Wesley shows an immense talent for being able to make a lot out of so little. "
rotten," Olivier Assayas's drama does not quite know what it wants to be - a thriller, a study in grief, or one long advert for luxury brands."
fresh," Intriguing docu about missing musician; some language, pot."
rotten," Look deeply into Stardust and all you see is a slightly diluted Princess Bride, and a happily-ever-after you've seen a dozen times before."
rotten, The movie's heart is in a socially-conscious place when the high concept demands something fundamentally different.
rotten," Some credit is due for artistic courage and craftiness on Lowery's part for this low-budget wonder, but ultimately A Ghost Story doesn't hang together in any substantive way."
fresh," Surely one of the most cruelly tragic, and sublimely funny, melodramas of all time."
rotten, I think McG just wants to show he can spend more money blowing up more stuff more better than Michael Bay. And that's just McDumb.
rotten," Ratchet & Clank fulfills everything you might expect from one of the games in the franchise, but I was fascinated seeing how unsatisfied that left me when I didn't have a controller in my hand."
rotten," Noisy neighbor revenge, a robotic kill for mom masked maniac chopaholic wielding sharp implements, and horny cookie cutter party animal bare breasted babes and boozers who frolic through these ho hum sex 'n slaughter pathological proceedings."
rotten," The actresses are dynamite, Kendrick in particular, each lighting up the screen with a ferocious glee that's inspiring. But gosh did I find a lot of this tiresome."
fresh," A beautifully dressed diet plate that nonetheless requires a man-sized proviso: That's still the brilliant Gosling onscreen, and that alone probably merits your money."
fresh, It was unique but felt unfair and superficial to all involved especially Nancy.
fresh, It's powerful and compassionate right to the very last shot.
rotten," Writer Ryan Engle did Non-Stop (psycho on a plane) & The Commuter (psycho on a train). This is psychos (plural) in a home. Boring movie but gratefully, no Liam Neeson."
fresh, The opening and closing dance numbers are so brilliant and uplifting that they are probably the best sequences in cinema all year. 
fresh," War Horse is about war, and it is about the ways that animals can teach us to be more human. It's too long, but it is inspiring."
rotten," This is a left-footed and clumsily insistent work, exposing the worst aspects inherent to the Dardennes' style."
fresh," By simply watching the participants talk about their feelings, sometimes in the vaguest of terms, McLeary illustrates how men build strong façades to conceal their pain from others and themselves."
fresh," A visually stunning and often surprising true story that charts the rise of the Colombian drug business back before Escobar from its unexpected roots, among an indigenous clan in way over their heads."
fresh, Deliciously funny!
fresh," Thanks to a manic pop-art animation style, this is a version of Spider-man that both honours his comic-books origins while giving us a hero for today. "
fresh," It smartly avoids trying to make some grand political statement, while also not turning the perpetrators into victims. It's more concerned with the psychology leading up to the crime than the physical violence."
rotten, Vera's technical prowess ends up selling his film short; he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them.
rotten," Artistically, the film is the waste product of income inequality, masquerading as commentary. Its desire to make the 1970s look like vomit is relentless."
rotten," If you think that Jennifer Lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry Ben Affleck, wait till you see Maid in Manhattan."
fresh," The ending is happy and ironic in equal measure, but most of the fun is just getting there with the right chemistry and compatibility."
rotten," De Bont remains an expert director of action, but putting the reference to cruise control in the title serves as fair warning of an unengaged filmmaker on automatic pilot."
rotten," An overtly melodramatic, televisual endeavour that harks back to classic b-movie thrillers of the 90s."
rotten, [A] visually dazzling but leaden adaptation.
fresh, Few people who walk out of this movie will be able to forget Carey Mulligan's Jenny ... finds many layers in the way it explores the world at that time.
rotten," t's possible that Every Thing Will Be Fine is understated to a fault, that excavating its deeper meanings is deliberately impeded rather than enabled by its gently casual vibe."
rotten, Dinner for Schmucks belongs to that mangy breed of American comedy that confuses situations that are genuinely funny for situations that are agonisingly awkward.
rotten, Everything about it is so indie that it feels like it's following a formula as rigid as that of any romcom or teen-meat-on-the-hoof slasher picture.
rotten," Next time, if the Turtles really want to hurt 'em, they should call on Hammer."
rotten," Those who like working a Rubik's Cube might find Duplicity appealing. With a lack of charisma, sexual chemistry or sizzle, it left me sadly disappointed."
fresh, The film's best achievement may be the way it reminds us that restaurants have become entertainments unto themselves.
rotten, The writer gets as tangled in his own explanations as a puppy in a 30-foot leash.
rotten," [Hello, My Name is Doris] is a largely unfunny movie about a sad sack woman."
fresh, An exquisite piece of streamlined suspense and action that clearly demonstrates that [Spielberg] was already in full control of his vision.
rotten," Stone's film, more an act of boosterism than inquiry, is a tremendous missed opportunity."
fresh," You may have missed this little Aussie gem of an actioner, as it slid into and out cinemas quickly before landing on digital platforms and DVD/blu-ray; no reason to miss it now, and every reason to take a look."
rotten," Wider in scope than its predecessor and technically more ambitious. It's a lot of other things, too, including clumsy, obvious and safe."
rotten," This collapses into comic mayhem, falling-out-of-trees slapstick, snore-bore misunderstandings and a sizeable distance between laughs."
rotten, blows more than the acctresses in the directors old movies
rotten," If you saw ""The Hangover"" and thought, ""I would enjoy this film more if nothing of consequence happened, and it were clean enough to screen at a retirement home,"" then ""Last Vegas"" is custom made for your needs."
rotten," At 15 minutes this side of three hours, it's longer than Spider-Man 3 and the last Pirates entry, which were both long enough. These are supposed to be popcorn movies, not Berlin Alexanderplatz."
fresh," Clipping along with a snappy script that isn't afraid to be silly, this rip-snorting swathe of derring-do is thoroughly enjoyable."
fresh," The humour may be too broad in places -- corpse-based slapstick pales with repetition -- but, for the most part, 'Burke and Hare' is well-timed and often funny."
fresh," Adam is a quiet, contemplative film with a quirky heart and soul - it's just a shame that it's trapped in such a familiar framework."
fresh," The explosion of AIDS is the film's sobering heart, but the manner in which it affects those who witness it makes the story universal and, through each person's small, life-affirming reactions, hopeful."
fresh," A film that leaves us great features: evocative names, credible settings and, above all, amazing warriors. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten," I thought Hayden Christensen in last year's Jumper would be as bland a mutant as the screen would ever give us, but that was before I saw Chris Evans in Push."
fresh," Most animated movies try to deliver a message and end up sounding preachy. Sing too, has one -- once you hit rock bottom, there's nowhere else to go but up. The sheer heart with which its characters live and convey the sentiment, is incredible."
fresh," Infused with rich writing, strong performances and symbolic undertones, Darjeeling explores how people behave when living in the moment but out of the comfort zone."
fresh," By embracing the original series' tacky elements and inserting just enough self-mockery to avoid smugness, the movie manages to fulfill basic expectations."
rotten," This crudely made thriller plays like a stilted Cantonese riff on organized-crime cliches, substituting blood and brutality for novelty or insight."
rotten," In general the picture is so committed to inoffensiveness and to hammering home its uplifting, bootstrap message that it lacks the necessary element of malice."
fresh," It is, by definition, nonfiction, but at times suggests a horror movie."
fresh," An astonishing piece of work, as spectacular as it is emotionally exhausting, as dynamic as it is rooted in the moment."
rotten," Frankly, saying ""it could have been worse"" about the film fits in nicely with the tone of the entire piece."
fresh," Ron is willing to live with the pain because at least it's living, which, we can almost hear him saying in that Texas twang, is better than the alternative."
fresh," A great film, drunkenly beautiful and deeply disturbing."
fresh, A film that even non believers can enjoy because of the interesting take on this tale and great production values. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh," The results here are still hit-and-miss, but the hits are usually strong and the go-for-broke attitude of the overall production proves infectious."
fresh, A terrific nail-biter with Bryan Cranston leading exceptional performances from a very good cast. Intense times 10 and digs into places most undercover movies don't. 
fresh, This is a deliriously cinematic romp that demands to be seen on the big screen.
fresh," The biggest surprise (and asset) here is Pegg, who imbues the slightly daft Shaun with a good nature and bigger heart, providing the film with a central figure you actually care about."
rotten," Sluggish for a Jerry Bruckheimer production, but maybe the kids will learn something."
rotten," ""Django"" will leave fans of the legend merely eager to return to their beloved recordings and let their ears take in the greatness."
rotten," It's certainly not a bad movie. It's got enough entertainment value to warrant a rental on a dull night at home, just not enough to recommend rushing out to your local theater."
rotten," Edgar Allan Poe, serial-killer hunter. That's the lamebrain concept of the eerie writer's mysterious final days in Baltimore as posited in this misdirected effort."
rotten, Never in the field of blockbuster movies has so much been spent on so little.
fresh," Australia works well enough to recommend, but this will likely be the least-worshiped movie in Luhrmann's filmography."
rotten," It tries to impersonate a much better movie, but even a twist at the end cannot make it compelling. "
rotten," The film is really much ado about very little because it takes no stand and gives little insight into the Chopper's psyche , all while too carefully catering to his machinated media image."
rotten," It contains nothing that is offensive, challenging, or complex, nor does it contain any great deal of wit, color, or imagination."
rotten," There's a lot of loud action. There are a lot of flashy visuals. Everything goes by quickly. It's just that, like Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice, it's not a hell of a lot of fun."
fresh," Your conscience may tell you everyone is up to no good, but it's too much devious fun not to enjoy."
fresh," It is an awsome experience, visually; on the story side it's a tad thin."
rotten, Covers a lot of overly familiar morbid teen-who-finds-love ground. 
rotten," Be warned, sequel fanboys: This thing sucks! At 62, Neeson still has a glare that means badass. Nothing else makes a damn lick of sense. The only thing getting taken is the audience. "
fresh, A sassy and charming romantic comedy where the loosely scripted laughs play authentically and sometimes painfully. 
rotten," More stupefying follies may come, but it's impossible to imagine how they'll beat this one for staggering idiocy, fatuousness or pretension."
rotten, The trouble with derivative horror flicks that don't have any new ideas is that you get bored waiting for all hell to break loose in the last 20-30 minutes.
fresh, A small miracle to have a great time with. [Full review in Spanish] 
fresh, Filled with the kind of funny detail that has become a Pixar trademark.
rotten, Another attempt to adapt a young adult novel that fails to justify the adaptation.
fresh, Helps to make Khodorkovsky more of a reality than the enigma he threatens to become.
fresh," Thunderous, metallic, ominous, screeching sound effects add to the sensory perception that you're watching a megaton monster barreling toward a dramatic showdown."
rotten, Something like this should have been way more interesting.
rotten," The fault for this flaccid comedy lies not in Freundlich's stars, but in the way he portrays his men and women as biologically-driven boobs."
rotten," Finding Neverland moved me at times but didn't transport me, either to Edwardian London in the first instance, or from there to Neverland."
rotten," Davis ends up a wasted resource. She does her best to elevate the material, but the story fails to live up to her considerable talents."
fresh, The atmosphere is the most important character in the film. 
rotten," Must Love Dogs treats originality as if it were a disease, passing up almost every attempt to include the kind of ingredients that might take someone by surprise."
rotten," The film's message is still relevant, but it's already universally recognized how far the executive branch will go to get its latest war on."
fresh," Time Out is not just an especially subtle and thoughtful psychological drama, it's a provocative, even an unnerving one as well."
fresh," A string of A-list British acting talent adds a zing of interest to this somewhat uneven Woody Allen relationship farce. Yet despite its failings, the film is enjoyably watchable and packed with knowing observations."
fresh," Like all the best war movies -- no matter what war, what era -- The Hurt Locker goes to the core of human nature."
rotten," Grease 2 is a bad movie that really doesn't deserve much of a defense. There are moments in it that are so cringeworthy, one might think they were the reason fast-forward buttons were included on VCRs."
rotten," Uninspired, trivial, and relentlessly chipper anyway"
rotten," Can you say ""cheesy?"" ... Less successful than George Lucas wanted, this movie may be."
fresh, Strong performances by Stephen Dorff and Melissa George plus a haunting script make this a hunt out and see movie.
rotten," An austere film-making exercise, wallowing in anguish and despair. There's a reason why it was rejected by both Netflix and Amazon."
rotten," Director Wayne Wang, stung no doubt by the poor reception given his NC-17 fit of boldness The Center of the World, tries to freshen up this stinker through confusion and implausibility."
fresh," An appealingly good-natured piece, chock-full of beautifully-observed moments, in both the teachers and pupils lives."
fresh," A slight, glancing, yet subtly wrought slice of New York life. And it seems likely that the exceedingly modest Cunningham would want it that way."
fresh," The piece has a roaring sophomoric quality and quite a fixation on penises, but generally gets to the comic finish line."
rotten, The Dan Rather biopic is really more about Mary Mapes whose basic journalism failure cost both of them their jobs. It's called Truth. Not so sure that's an accurate title. 
rotten, Just because a film is about dance doesn't mean it can function without a plot and a modicum of decent dialogue. Step Up: All In has neither.
rotten, A baby-boomer masturbatory center
rotten," This set-up and development is fascinating, the payoff less so."
fresh," The Visitor doesn't come close to answering all the questions it raises, but that's the film's M.O.: If nothing makes sense, then nothing is off limits."
rotten," Wait a sec, does anyone, other than M.I.A. perhaps, rely so heavily and stridently as Judy does on an acronym-heavy parlance?"
fresh," Politics aside, The Hunting Party is a breezy, occasionally bumpy ride that ultimately becomes a satisfying journey."
rotten, I've never seen a movie - let alone a children's movie - miss its mark as spectacularly and borderline offensively as this. 
fresh, A pretty fantastic horror drama with a meaningful message...
fresh," ... The Return of the King, is not only the best of the trilogy, but also one of the most amazing pieces of entertainment to grace the big screen."
fresh," Sir Ian is a pleasure to watch, though the drama isn't as compelling as it might have been."
fresh," Works better in the parts, comedy in the first half and action-drama in the second, than on the whole but still, you can't help but enjoy Game Night. "
fresh," Just as Bridge of Spies poster will tell you, it's ""directed by Steven Spielberg,"" and that will always make it worthwhile viewing."
fresh, One of the true classics of splatterdom. Sickeningly wonderful.
fresh, It's a hoot and a half.
fresh, Stewart shows she's now one of the most interesting actresses of her generation.
fresh," It may not be great cinema, this plain translucent story, but it point-scores delicately and without malice."
fresh, A case study in how an unrepentant formula picture can be made to seem like it has nothing to be sorry about.
fresh," For a movie about movies, it's surprisingly humanistic, cheerful and true to life."
rotten," White Boy Rick isn't unusual often enough to stand apart, or nakedly emotional enough to push through its increasing reliance on tired genre standards."
fresh, Hulk might be the first comic book film worthy of the art house.
rotten," Alfredson delights in showing ways people's noggins become detached from their bodies, but the queasy unsettling feeling those scenes produce mostly just serves to keep the viewer from falling asleep."
fresh," An exquisitely calibrated, deadpan-comic miniature that expands in the mind and becomes richer and more tragic."
fresh," ""Arrival""...is dynamic with a strong central character. Furthermore, it's the pondering thoughts it leaves us with in the end that are perhaps its most powerful asset. "
fresh," There is, in this singular film, enough crackpot philosophy, apocalyptic violence, environmental evangelism and portentous dialogue to inspire a whole new religion."
fresh," The spectacular Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a triumph of the producers' creed: Pound the senses, simulate emotion and milk the golden calf of the familiar like a mechanical farmhand."
rotten, Owen Wilson and Jack Black appear on the verge of succumbing to the same terminal blandness that's gripped Martin for so long.
rotten," While 1978's Superman remains the best superhero movie ever made, this desultory spinoff wouldn't even crack the genre's top 50 (or 60, or 70...)."
rotten, Kin is proof positive that people who play too many video games shouldn't be allowed to make feature-length films.
rotten," It puts us at a disadvantage for comprehending Claire, and it puts Claire at a disadvantage for becoming a recipient of our sympathy."
rotten," Too reliant on exaggerated characters and situations, and often looking and feeling like a TV show."
fresh, Earthy and honest... Both Salanic and Herrera deliver such off-handed performances that the audience often feels like voyeurs.
fresh," A journey of crisis and transformation as an ageing actor (Michael Keaton) battles colleagues, family and friends, but mostly his own powerful inner demons."
fresh," A film that tells a story in a simple way, without going beyond or getting to impact us but the narration is so dynamic that can't be said that its fails are so serious. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten, Shows early promise but eventually ends up in the bin of ordinariness.
rotten, The structure is familiar and the tension is lacking.
rotten, This dull trifle forced me to co-opt the names Sleepy and Grumpy for the duration of its running time.
rotten," Aside from Russell's shameless performance, the movie is also afflicted with easily anticipated sight gags."
fresh," E. M. Forster's Howards End makes a most compelling drama, perhaps the best film made during the 30-year partnership of Ismail Merchant and James Ivory."
rotten," As slow, lifeless and sloppily stitched together as its monster, this movie is a massive dud, undeserving of its goofy name."
fresh," as many weak spots, but what it delivers at its core is as indelible as (and a lot more explicit than) the work of such legendary teams as Clark Gable and Joan Crawford, Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. "
rotten," For all its good intentions, there's something deeply unsettling about this bubblegum pop approach to environmentalism."
rotten," A hyperbolic melodrama which oversimplifies its issues, and features too many scenes of Binoche weeping against picturesque Irish landscapes."
fresh," This playful and elegiac documentary is wholly of a piece with Sarah Polley's fiction work, and just as rewarding."
fresh, Not much sense of purpose or unity to [director Angela] Ismailos' selection of subjects or the random strands of conversation included in her film.
fresh, Charlie' s Angels is the kind of empty-calorie good time you can enjoy in the moment and forget about on your way to the parking lot.
fresh," This fantastical fairy tale could be labeled a more perverse version of Mannequin, especially given its blunt sex scenes and twisted outcome."
rotten, [Hopkins and Gooding Jr.] keep Instinct afloat on its sea of simplisms through a succession of climaxes until at last it reaches its unavoidable ending.
fresh," Entertaining, if lightly inquisitive, tribute concert film."
rotten," Rough Night is a film of few surprises and fewer delights, a one-idea film that has difficulty filling out its overly generous 101 minutes."
fresh, Marlene Dietrich tries not to give anything away as usual while Agatha Christie's whodunit plot whirs tidily about her expressionless beauty.
rotten," Sap, sentiment, and hokey plot devices bog down an otherwise down to earth story."
fresh," [An] assured suspense drama, which sports little of the blackly comedic streak usually associated with its maker ..."
fresh, A performance by Meryl Streep of endless intelligence cannot keep this portrait of Thatcher from being the sentimental nonsense she spent her career trying to avoid. 
fresh," Saliently researched, telling a wild but not inconceivable tale absorbing for its artistic prowess and attention to detail."
fresh," a terrific film in its first half, where screenwriters...have rejiggered the characters into a bunch of science and engineering geeks, but once its super hero aspects kick in, the film becomes derivative and tedious."
fresh," School Life is a pleasant film about the quiet, pain-staking work of engaged educators."
rotten," Too much naturalism, not enough style."
fresh, This Robocop manages to resurrect the franchise and establish a strong build-up for sequels to follow.
fresh," Thematically massive, tonally bold, determinedly non-formulaic and featuring a perfectly cast leading man at the top of his game ... Movies this good don't come along that often. Funny, moving, tender, tough ... just endless things about it to love. "
rotten, I can't recommend Speed Kills to anyone because it's not even good enough to gawk at.
rotten," A story told in snippets inevitably feels disjointed, despite the best efforts of Hyde and her cinematographer Brian Mason (who also edited the film) to get everything flowing smoothly."
rotten, Mature road-trip dramedy doesn't go anywhere new.
rotten, Chéri's saga of bad parenting ostensibly has to do with designs and rituals of love.

rotten, A society genetically engineering its citizens to stop aging could [assumedly] engineer its people to turn off the freaking neon green light on their arm that displays their remaining time. 
fresh," It isn't half bad: unmemorable but fast and flashy, and less bloated than the kind of action number that keeps John Travolta in Lear jets."
fresh," proves that it is still possible in the cinema, if not in television, to inform without being boring and entertain without condescending."
rotten, Liable to disappear mysteriously from cinemas.
rotten," The plot is lean, the dialogue is spare and there are some intriguing stabs at intellectual and emotional terrain. But the pacing is deadly, so slow there might be time for a catnap or two without missing anything important."
fresh, Documentary subjects don't come much more niche and nerdy than film archiving in Afghanistan.
fresh," Taylor inhabits the role with a focussed but uninhibited imperiousness, as when she turns Cleopatra's entrance into Rome, aboard a giant rolling sphinx, into the ultimate red-carpet photo op."
rotten," Kate Winslet remains a welcome distraction as matriarchal Jeanine and Miles Teller proves better than the material but, in terms of both visuals and story, this is tired and derivative."
rotten," Locked into a scheme of formal rigor and peek-a-boo screenwriting, the film is too busy calling attention to its own cleverness to allow any room for emotional connection."
rotten, Dark Shadows makes almost no attempt to reward cinema audiences.
fresh," ...a horror movie that manages to be scary, funny, suspenseful and even a parody of other horror movies."
rotten, Rarely have I felt such disconnect between material and the actors tasked with performing it as I did with Mark Waters' Vampire Academy.
fresh," If you know what's coming, it might just kill the effect. That said, going in blind will almost guarantee a genuinely chilling horror movie experience that should be seen at the cinema."
rotten, The subject matter is interesting but I was disappointed with its delivery. The screenplay is repetitious.
fresh, The film turns into a discussion over the validity of utopias. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten," With echoes of The Matrix, RoboCop and Total Recall, Ghost in the Shell feels that bit too familiar and the narrative never keeps pace with the action and special effects."
rotten," The movie never rises above trite and obvious gags: bodies in car trunks, lunkhead henchmen, idiot feds with their wires crossed."
fresh," A wearying end to a grand journey, the cinematic equivalent of a greatest hits encore."
rotten, The year's most overrated picture. Don't bother.
rotten, Might have been at least a little diverting had even an ounce of ingenuity been applied.
fresh," It's well-acted and more importantly, it's fun."
rotten," The pic's general stupidity, careless direction and reliance on a single-joke premise that was never really funny to begin with are only the most obvious of its problems."
fresh, I'm really hoping this makes a ton of money and sparks a trend of mainstream animated features that rely more on plot and character than on by-the-numbers cartoonisms.
fresh," Caniba offers no trite explanations or condemnations of Sagawa. Instead, we are offered a small window into his reality."
rotten," The Last Airbender is dreadful, an incomprehensible fantasy-action epic that makes the 2007 film The Golden Compass, a similarly botched adaptation of a beloved property from another medium, look like a four-star classic."
rotten, Titus does no justice to Shakespeare.
fresh," ""The Martian"" may be stitched together with recognizable bits, but they fit together into an entertainment that's better than any of the sources it's plundered."
fresh," I laughed throughout this sharp, witty and observant film that makes us look closely at ourselves, as we address serious issues"
rotten, Spills blood everywhere but has no pulse.
fresh," This is not only a dark drama about female vulnerability, but it's also a riveting low-key thriller about corrupt power."
rotten, A crude episode of 48 Hours. 
rotten, The familiarity and predictability of its scenario about co-dependency in the lower depths make the relatively short Canadian indie seem longer than it is.
fresh," There's just enough over-the-top action in this revenge-thriller. In fact, the action is enough to right this vehicle even when the plotting gets a little sketchy or convoluted."
fresh," It's a beautiful, supremely touching performance from Chalamet which gives this surprisingly safe story a deeply-moving purity."
fresh," Moderadamente divertido, mas facilmente esquecível."
fresh, A respectful and creative treatment of sex and the mysteries of love by director Sarah Polley with a stunning performance by Michelle Williams.

rotten, Dana Carvey is slowly strangling his own legacy with an inane script and flatulence jokes that could've been written on the elementary school playground.
fresh," Jonze's film could probably have been condensed into a half hour ""Twilight Zone""-type episode, but I will admit that Phoenix, and especially the sultry voice of Scarlett, keep this feature length film intriguing. "
fresh," If ""And Now, Ladies and Gentlemen"" were more judicially constructed and less busy with its many stories it could have been a better film."

fresh," Although it's state of the art, one might say that in terms of its values, it's the best animated film of the 19th century."
rotten, An unoriginal thriller that's boring and a total waste of time. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten," 'Silent House' is a horror movie that runs the gamut of emotions from tedium to unintentional mirth to irritation. Curiously, the only sensation this film misses is fear."
fresh," Coming in at a fairly miraculous 85 minutes ... its built-for-speed, no-nonsense style goes a long way toward juicing this summer's dog days."
fresh," This is a talented comedic cast, but in the second half of the film they don't get to do a lot that's funny."
rotten," As a fan of the 1980s Saturday morning cartoon and Hasbro toys the film is based on, I was saddened to see characters I grew up with transformed into a corporate ad tool."
rotten," While a slight improvement over its beautifully gothic, hopelessly empty predecessor, Underworld: Evolution retains many of that picture's problems."
rotten," With the ""Saturday Night Live"" stamp of approval all over it...we deserve better, much better."
fresh, Only worthwhile storytellers could take an elevator pitch like this one (the last two people on Earth) and produce long-lasting curiosity about its inherent beauty and horror.
rotten," For all its playfulness, the new ""RoboCop"" can't help but lack the novelty of the original's jolting mixture of dumb-smart irony and visceral pulp."
fresh, The ensemble and milieu allow for some wonderfully organic tensions and commentary around masculinity and wanderlust. 
rotten, [Prey at Night] ditches most of what made the 2008 original work. Tension and atmosphere are replaced with bland stalk-and-slash bromides.
fresh," For all its simple politics, clanging dialogue, and underwritten roles -- only Damon's natural, and deepening, ability to suggest unspoken disappointment gives his character dimension -- Elysium works, though never as well as it should."
fresh, You'll forget there's anything but an edge to your seat.
fresh," In one of the quickest reteamings in history, Saoirse Ronan and Billy Howle are back together after last week's release of The Seagull in this unusually honest and poignant drama of two young marrieds in trouble from day one."
fresh," Many times in life, we let our hearts overrule our minds. Such is the case with Thea Sharrock's ""Me Before You,"" a slick piece of treacle that manages to charm as it flirts with insulting the audience's intelligence throughout."
rotten, A flat and uninteresting adaptation of Hamlet.
fresh," I did not find the film overly long; it is fascinating to watch the narrative unfold, driven as it is by the low-key antics of its main characters. The time breezed by like a brisk walk by the Rhine."
rotten," Wes Bentley's screaming and ranting is (unintentionally) funny, not unnerving. It's like being menaced by Tobey Maguire."
fresh," Nearly every scene feels true, as if lifted directly from your own family reunion."
rotten," Movies about flesh-eating viruses don't come along every day. Cabin Fever, which opens today, demonstrates why."
fresh," Prisoners is, first and foremost, a crime drama in which Villeneuve and screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski slowly ratchet the suspense by making the audience privy to clues the characters do not have the opportunity to put together."
fresh, Vadim Perelman's impressively self-assured directing debut harvests the terror and grandeur of classical tragedy from the everyday sorrows of contemporary American life.
fresh," In what is clearly a labor of love, Estevez has assembled an extraordinary cast to present a mosaic of American culture at one of the '60s' key turning points. Estevez may milk the final sequence a little too long, but the result is deeply affecting."

fresh, A stunning debut that finds its dandelion-haired heroine fighting rising tides and fantastic creatures in a mythic battle against modernity.
rotten," Given the relationship of the installation to the film and the film to the installation, it's impossible for one work not to overcloud one's view of the other."
fresh, Shipenko... is able to harmonize narrative clarity and sense of entertainment. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten," You know I love a movie with talking animals, but Hollywood seems intent on destroying the genre."

fresh, the closest you'll get to actually having a nightmare in a movie theatre outside of a midnight screening of David Lynch's Eraserhead. 
fresh, Future generations may regard I.O.U.S.A. as the most important film of 2008. Not the best. Not the most entertaining. Just the most important.
fresh," Visually speaking, the lurid spookfest is an absolute stunner."
rotten," It leaves me unmoved, although I can see why it appeals to some, with its ethereal touches, its internal workings and its cute children, all wrapped in the melancholy story of a husband and father taken too soon from them in an outback accident. "
fresh," Despite the obvious aim to win sympathy for its hard-luck hero, the film is less manipulative than it is faithful to the outlines of Segawa's life. "
fresh," Liam Neeson's punches save the day in this satisfying, 90s-inspired Jaume Collet-Serra locomotive."
fresh," Widows is ultimately a story of female empowerment, but, through its sensitive vision and careful technique, it never lets us forget the wounds that come with the victory."
fresh, It's a film of delicious performances and great wit.
fresh," Matangi / Maya / M.I.A. delivers the goods in a lot of ways, but begs for a fuller picture of the vivid artist."
rotten," It's a wild yarn, but that's all Finders Keepers aspires to be; its gestures toward any statements about class and micro-celebrity are fleeting and half-hearted."
rotten, Could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes Fatal Attraction look like a classic by comparison? That's the only sane rationale I can think of for Swimfan's existence.
fresh," The Hate U Give gives people a shared language with which to unite and fight oppression. If all it does is teach a generation of Starrs to use their voice, that alone would be profound."
fresh, A potent and imaginative creative biography of virtuoso percussionist Glennie.
rotten, Jennifer Coolidge's accent goes from Australian to pirate in six seconds and the paid cast members sidestep her errors like turds on a hunting green...If only it were funnier. 
fresh," It's a serotonin-depleted ordeal, and yet seemingly a sketchbook of vibes and ideas to come, with some of the most magnificent black-and-white images shot anywhere in the world."
rotten, Alternately sweet and kind of creepy...an invitation you might want to skip.
rotten," Technically superb, Giant is hobbled by a script that plods earnestly along like the giant at its center, and like him it starts to limp soon after mid-point."
fresh, The visuals in Happy Feet are absolutely amazing. 
fresh," Grand Piano may be a bit silly at times, but the thrills it produces are enough to overcome its weaknesses."
fresh," A simple, though achingly insightful, story that illuminates the intense, complicated affection between girlfriends with sensitivity and restraint."
fresh, A surprisingly quiet and whimsical comedy about a ridiculous and unlikely series of events that turns into a nearly-as-likely miracle. Best bit: the film's own Sweded preview.
fresh," The film deserves credit, both for its breezy pacing and its uncommon tendency to make its characters smarter and geekier than they might have been."
fresh, Kelly Reichardt elicits every nuance from her small-town characters and leaves the viewer on the verge of reading their minds.
fresh," ...if you think you are going to be witnessing something in the vein of your typical death and destruction flick like THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW or 2012, you will probably be horrified by the depravity on display. "
fresh, It manages to expand the Pokémon world in surprisingly interesting ways. [Full review in Spanish]

fresh," A fascinating, funny and cautionary look at how a world of group hugs and high fives transforms into night sweats and icy stares."
rotten, It would be easy to laugh off if it wasn't so clearly a comment on historical reality.
fresh," [VIDEO] As much a behind-the-scenes peek at Jim Henson's creative process as a biopic about a kid with a vision, ""Being Elmo"" is about Clash's supportive parents who helped guide him in the direction he wanted to go. "
rotten, Sometimes it takes a disaster of this magnitude to leave us hoping a studio will take a long hard look at the universe they're about to expand.
rotten, The plot of Turtles II hinges on toxic waste and that turns out to be a pretty accurate description of the film.
rotten," ... when characters are not racing at breakneck speed, the movie as a whole ceases to move."
rotten," Cavalier when not in your face cocky, this Hollywood notion of a dumbed down, sexed up Harvard is less brainiac boot camp than Ivy League Club Med where nobody does homework. A hyper-capitalist homage to Facebook, and an infomercial in biopic clothing."
rotten, The threat that this mess of a movie might be followed by a sequel is enough to make anyone cry uncle.
rotten," It's all sheen and spectacle, without the affection or personality of the original."
fresh, Stern and his lead actor do manage to pull it all together at the end.
fresh," Miller is a witty and socially acute observer; the three portraits in ""Personal Velocity"" are told with both novelistic richness and brisk, confident economy."
fresh," Zippy and saturated with soft-core nudity, The Look of Love isn't hard to watch ..."
rotten," There are a few moments of inspired lunacy, but for the most part, it's sluggish and tedious."
fresh," ... while the film's blunter, more thrillerish and sadistic second half is less unnerving than its bloodless first, it still works as a smarter than usual cat-and-mouse death match."
rotten," An interesting addition to a distinctive career, but not Reichardt at her best."
rotten," Thompson makes Ruskin such a cardboard villain, playing on stereotypes of the cold, stuffy intellectual, that she turns Gray's story into a tastefully dreary domestic-prison saga."
rotten," Supposed to be a subversive hybrid of disaster movies and gory horror, but it's uncertain where the two actually meet."
fresh," It's a companionable enough experience, even though the title should really be ""Zack Makes a Porno (with Miri)."""
rotten," It's time for Derrickson, who also directed The Exorcism of Emily Rose, to master a new ritual."
rotten, Any pretence of thoughtful debate has long since been abandoned.
rotten, It's as if it looked at possible templates for excitement and willfully decided to go for something more disjointed and boring.
rotten," Sleepy looks good, but acting is headless."
fresh," Its whimsical, free-ranging nature is often enchanting; the first hour, in particular, is brimming with amiable, sardonic laughs. But there comes a point where you feel like Jeunet is forcing whimsy down your throat with a plunger."
rotten," Unfortunately, director Bryan Buckley's toothless and raunchy comedy does not quite land on its feet smoothly enough to earn a decent score from the sideline judges."
rotten," No background whatsoever is given, from initial intentions to their invariably sympathetic turns, to understand the motivation driving most of the character arcs..."
rotten," If you really want to get smart, you'll avoid this tiresome time-waster like the proverbial plague."
rotten," The night is dark and not so full of terrors in ""Game of Thrones"" star Natalie Dormer's first foray into C-grade J-horror."
fresh, A fun film filled with performances that are perfect for the story that it's trying to tell. [Full Review in Spanish]
fresh, A gleefully violent -- and improbably feminist -- phantasmagoria that turns epic road rage and long stretches of vehicular omnicide into an eye-boggling joy ride.
fresh," The most intense, intimate and inspirational film since Slumdog Millionaire."
fresh, For all the hype surrounding the film adaptation of Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code the movie is surprisingly typical. 
fresh," At times it is oppressively morose, but it has a nice dusting of social realism to go with the violence, and reaches an agreeably nasty conclusion."
fresh, Honors the Arthur Conan Doyle legacy as much as the engrossing BBC series starring Benedict Cumberbatch -- and certainly more than those daft action romps featuring Robert Downey Jr. as Indiana Holmes.
rotten," Righteous, but plodding. "
fresh, Something more than an assembly line creature feature. And Salva backs up his disturbed subtext with passable spookshow affection.
fresh," Despite its flaws, at least The Express does its best to honor this groundbreaking player's memory."
fresh," Ficarra and Requa don't always have the firmest grip on storytelling needs, but they manage to find life in the middle of Hell, with ""Foxtrot"" achieving levels of entertainment other pictures of this ilk have failed to acquire."
rotten," I wonder what those MPAA members who gave this a PG-13 were smoking. Filled with crude, raunchy sexual references, it should have been R-rated."
rotten, A series of serviceable creep-outs and jolts...the pretzel-shaped resolution feels like too little too late.
fresh," Working within a tradition of heightened, impressionistic satire, Veiroj demonstrates a rare aptitude for depicting his distraught protagonist's emotional world."
fresh," A searing character study unfolding against a variety of visually-captivating L.A. locales ranging from the seamy to the posh, and underscored by an appropriately-gritty soundtrack. "
rotten," King fans were troubled to learn that the film adaptation would only be 95 minutes long; for most of us, that'll be more than plenty."
fresh, Café de Flore very much floored me and its enigmatic charm continued to weasel its way into my mind long after it was over.
rotten," Something's missing. Although the movie is tense, it's not the white-knuckle experience you might expect, with the most suspenseful scenes coming across as manufactured."
rotten," Smith tries hard here, but that's part of the problem - beads of sweat are all over this thing."
fresh," ""Pride"" is an unapologetic crowd-pleaser of a movie, but it has some potent points to make, and the reality of what happened has a power of its own."
rotten, A movie that takes as long to move itself through its motions as the last Catholic Church wedding I attended.
fresh, Gets the job done in a clean and efficient manner and those in the mood for some low-key spookiness that avoids being either too gory or too stupid are advised to give it a chance.
rotten," Foxx is not at fault here -- with Ray, he arrives at the front ranks of American film actors -- but the filmmakers' need to bend biography until it assumes triumphal shape is."
rotten," The screenplay is credited to four writers, director John Luessenhop among them, and they've all been busy cutting-and-pasting from other movies."
rotten," Good for Shawn Levy for going outside of his comfort zone, but as much as he may dislike being typecast as a director, he should keep that 'mindless family movie' door open as long as he possibly can."
fresh," Original, moving drama has some disturbing moments. "
rotten, Spotlight isn't the kind of film that just changes some facts; it's one where the most general plot summary contradicts what happened.
rotten," It's exactly the sort of movie that Hollywood specializes in, the kind which seems on paper as if it ought to be entertaining, but winds up a massive and chaotic drag."
fresh," There is so much going on, filmed with such style, that I found it hard to stop being fascinated."
rotten, A throwback to red scare movies of the 1950s with Julian Assange portrayed as the fanatical intellectual bent on destroying bourgeois society and the lives of those naive enough to follow him. Utter trash.
rotten," A Mr. Collins of a movie: fatuous, self-important, and nowhere near as smart or as elegant as it thinks it is. There isn't a lick of wit to be found here."
rotten," Frustratingly written, haphazardly episodic comic pastiche."
fresh," The important thing in the Francos script is not what is said, but what is reserved. This requires patience for the narrative of the film. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh, An amusing time-travel theme plus Hugh Jackman in his dashing Duke's uniform and Meg Ryan looking as perky as ever -- what more could incurable romantics ask for?
rotten, Kingsman would do wonders focusing on telling a coherent story and making Egerton a sex symbol instead of cooking up new female body parts to violate.
rotten, The problem with Arthur is far more about concept than execution.
fresh," Although I seem to have had higher expectations than I thought, the movie is super entertaining. We got fight scenes, car chases, undercover missions, mixed with the bumbling antics of the BFFs and genuine luck having duo."
fresh," Depictions of custody battles have become a cinematic staple, but few register with the heartfelt emotion of Any Day Now."
fresh," While the whole thing slips by smoothly, and Johansson effortlessly uses both gears in her repertoire, this was probably never going to be anything more than a serviceable rainy Tuesday afternoon film."
rotten," It's like a cover song by a decent, but forgettable tribute band. Their rendition hits all the proper notes, but lacks soul."
fresh, Nothing Like A Good Villian
rotten," While impressive for a low-budget horror comedy, goes off on too many tangents, ending up as an intriguing premise imperfectly realized. "
rotten," A misguided comedy that relies on obnoxious characters and mean, abrasive behavior."
fresh," Legally Blonde director Luketic keeps the film light and frothy, and the script (penned by three women) isn't afraid to flavour the romance with a little raunch."
fresh," ""Kong: Skull Island"" isn't going to change your life. Nor can it hold a candle to the 1933 original. But there are some good thrills to be had here - and some good fun, too."
rotten," For the love of God, I hope you don't see the next Paranormal Activity...Jesus, my head."
rotten," It's hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not."
fresh," There may not be the normal, anticipated dosage of sentiment to latch onto in this film, but in exchange for patience and a little faith, Button presents the exquisite weight of the human experience in a manner the screen rarely witnesses."
fresh, A motion picture of visual splendor and emotional depth.
fresh," William Wyler's adaption of the stage musical is transformative for many millennials. Whether wearing a hijab, sporting a yarmulke, or bareheaded, my students embrace Streisand's Brice and the star/character's professional chutzpah & insecurities."
fresh," If you fell in love with a spy, could you ever truly trust her? That question drives ""Allied,"" a World War II romance-thriller that starts off smartly but sputters to an underwhelming finale. "
fresh," Part of what makes Tragedy Girls so fun is not the blunt force satire, but how it makes the audience complicit in the girls' quest for fame and fortune."
rotten, Makes Lincoln look like Skyfall.
rotten," The folks behind Bewitched had an idea -- rejigger the '60s TV series about a witch who marries an average guy -- but they couldn't decide what kind of movie to make, so they came up with three scenarios and Superglued them together."
fresh," Fans of the book will likely be pleased. More importantly, people who don't know a thing about the books may get swept up, as well."
rotten," How can Tran Anh Hung, the director of 'Cyclo' and 'Tokio Blues (Norwegian Wood)' can fall so low? [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten," Imagining the imminent end of the world has been boring for years now in movies, and the low-budget sci-fi thriller ""Kill Switch"" is no exception."
fresh," A story that deserves to be told, although the film constantly reveals its commitment to not cause too many problems - neither moral nor ideological - to its viewers. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh," [Giamatti is] terrific throughout, although the movie, which is more clever than funny, sometimes resembles second-tier Charlie Kaufman stuff."
fresh," Director Mark Decena and co-writer, Tim Breitbach, have formulated that rare screenplay that adapts out of its characters and not a predetermined road. The camera doesn't just love Sabrina Lloyd - it's looking to get down on one leg and propose."
fresh," Ultimately a touching, funny documentary about family and cultural forces putting pressure on a first-generation Indian-American man to do what should come naturally: find love and a life partner."
rotten," If you're easily pleased by a bit of well-rendered CGI spectacle and cod-fantasy set dressing, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword will scratch that itch."
rotten," Big, boring slog with a plot familiar to Indiana Jones fans."
fresh, A gift to imagination.
fresh," Lucas Hedges provides a beating, aching heart at the center of Ben Is Back with his soulful performance, another reminder of why he is one of the most exciting young performers working today."
rotten," The dialogue is dumber than dirt, and the plot crumbles at the halfway mark, but the movie does what a loud summer blockbuster should, which is loudly bust blocks."
fresh," Despite some fine performances, Mary Queen of Scots ends up being a wonderful looking but still rather dull affair."
rotten," Several good ideas for a movie rumble around inside ATL, but they never coalesce."
rotten," It's the Spice Girls' music that is the movie's reason for being. It is fast-paced and upbeat, and the movie sags noticeably between songs."
fresh, Nolan uses unusual and new techniques to make the viewer feel as if she/he is actually experiencing the action--for better or worse. This is one of the great WWII films. 
rotten," Apesar de importante na gênese do gore, Lewis era um péssimo cineasta, roteirista, compositor e diretor de fotografia. Mas, como Ed Wood, seus filmes têm o charme da ruindade."
fresh, Director RJ Cutler trails the Devil Wears Prada inspiration in the run-up to the magazine's biggest and most important issue he still finds himself with an interesting story to tell.
rotten," Don't bother with this movie. If you're just itching for more Dukes, stick to the original series on DVD."
fresh, The Artist made me remember why I love movies.
fresh," Sex and the City, the movie, feels like a glorified television episode in the best possible sense - utterly unchanged in spirit from its small screen roots yet just ambitious enough to validate its big screen adaptation."
rotten," In the end, American Ultra is doomed by its nondescript script."
fresh, The directors show a great talent for jagged-edged farce.
fresh," Claude Miller's ingeniously freewheeling adaptation of ""The Seagull"" drags Chekhov's 1895 play into the age of cellphones, digital video and hip-hop."
fresh," A propulsive sci-fi actioner genetically engineered from spores of the Alien and Terminator series, Roger Donaldson's Species provides a gripping if not overly original account of an extraterrestrial species attempting to overwhelm our own."
fresh, Casual fans of anime would do better aiming a little higher...
fresh," Is vomit ever a good thing? 'Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted' is cinematic vomit, and that's a compliment."
fresh, This is the best film of its kind since Amy Heckerling's Clueless.
rotten, a smart movie wrapped inside a dumb movie
rotten, It might seem offensive if it weren't so lame.
fresh," A Girl at My Door is well-acted and crisply shot, a highly assured debut from Jung who should have a bright future as she grows beyond Lee's tutelage and develops her own voice."
fresh, Reynolds and especially the charming Smart give the movie the kind of heart one would not expect...
fresh," This is one of Mortensen's best performances, and ""The Two Faces of January"" is one gorgeously rendered old-school feature."
rotten," The Canyons is Easton Ellis cannibalising himself, Schrader badly forging Drive and hack stunt casting of a walking appendage and a starlet that should have been in rehab."
rotten," The production values are strong and the young cast engage, including Theo James and Miles Teller. But really, it's enough now."
rotten," Kudos to Eastwood for good intentions, but stories, like trains, need a dependable surface. This train is running on jointed tracks. "
fresh," One of the problems of Volf's ""in her own words"" approach is it makes for an elliptical biography. Little back-story, but lots of soundtrack and scenes of Callas at airports, looking devastating in her Kohl-eye makeup and fur stoles"
fresh, A great movie that doesn't know when to quit
fresh," Despite good casting, interesting sets and costumes and Armstrong's good direction, the viewers still might feel somewhat cheated -- instead of an interesting period piece they received ordinary melodrama."
rotten," Apart from a rather pointless cameo from Kenneth Branagh and a rather peaky-looking Richard Harris, in truth there was nothing in HP2 that we hadn't already seen in HP1."
fresh," It's highly amusing for grown-ups, too."
fresh," The man, who only has been superficially shown, gets lost for a while in the sweep of events. Yet in spite of these reservations, this lush film merits attention."
fresh, Cacoyannis emerged out of semi-retirement with this amusing farce about the wild and crazy inhabitants of modern-day Athens.
fresh," Click and Collect offered proof that, in certain circumstances, it is possible to have your cake and eat it."
fresh," Alita is powered by James Cameron's visionary world-building. But the last thing you want to use to sell something is ""written by James Cameron""."
rotten, What really hurts is Quaid's ridiculous idiot persona as the prez. It is simply too off center--even with a Texas twang.
fresh," This dank, dark and disturbing psychological horror film is a remake of a Hideo Nakata chiller, but the film it most evokes is Roman Polanski's Repulsion, another tale of mental instability and bad real estate."
rotten, Nails the tale's particulars but not its soul.
rotten, The problem with Passengers is not the selfishness but the laziness with which it has been wrapped in the garb of 'love'.
rotten, A film that doesn't fulfil the promise of its source material but still offers a novel setting and reasonably gripping - if rushed - story.
fresh," The movie is beautifully shot, and succeeds in being deeply disturbing and mysterious, with richly achieved nuances of characterisation. I have seen it two or three times now, and each time it gets better."
rotten," Against its own will, the story undermines its own happy conclusion."
fresh, 'Alita' has the look and feel of a Cameron sci-fi epic. The world building is sprawling. The effects are tip-top. The spectacle is massive.
rotten," For me, it mostly proved a waste of time."
fresh," Problematic yet essential, it arrives in theaters looking, if anything, even more caustic and timely than it did at its Cannes premiere."
rotten," Fey has the Sandra Bullock role -- exactly the kind of part that she has spent the last decade transcending. She's not bad in it, though."
fresh," [T]he relentless psychological desolation that rumbles ominously throughout is unique, and elevates it above most of the genre."
fresh," Though individual details may defy explanation, Zulawski maintains such expert control of the film's look and tone that there can be no question that each choice has been deliberate, whatever the significance."
fresh, Quietly seductive.
rotten," A mediocre, unimaginative, inefficient filmmaker, Columbus delivers a Rent that isn't so much bad as perfunctory."
fresh, Imagine a less upbeat Taxi Driver remixed mumblecore style.
rotten, A late turn for would-be weightiness is as unconvincing as it is abrupt.
rotten," His flamboyant rendering of the Mozart opera isn't as smug and stagey as Sleuth, but it is insufferable - and 40 minutes longer."
rotten," Even though The Heart of Me is meant to be all about passion, there's precious little of it on the screen."
fresh," A poetic, powerful work."
rotten," There are only so many times you can use the word ""formulaic"" before your voice becomes nothing more than white noise."
rotten, Rarely has so much imagination been poured into one facet of a film at the expense of another.
fresh," ""Vol. I"" works. ""Vol. II"" works you over, and von Trier likes it like that."
fresh," Breaks story-telling conventions by deliberately focusing on a single character, one with no back story, all in the service of praising individuality, resilience and ingenuity."
rotten, What director-writer-producer Lawrence Kasden delivers is as old as pod people.
rotten, This movie has plot holes big enough to fly a dragon through and relies on the audience's pre-existing knowledge of the original source material for everything to make sense.
rotten," As the film's title suggests, there is something inauthentic about it all."
rotten," [T]he kernels of a truly smart, truly honest, truly brilliant movie are here, and they get lost in what has become the standard Hollywood humiliation comedy..."
fresh," What her film lacks in novelty and momentum, it makes up for it in atmosphere. That, in the end, can be a more difficult thing to capture, and will serve her well as her career matures."
rotten, . . .a rambling mess that takes 110 minutes and an obscene amount of money all to let Shyamalan live out a revenge fantasy and to obsess over Howard's legs
rotten, Laverty has a proven track record as a grim social realist; he is less assured as a comic fantasist; and he is absolutely hopeless when he tries to combine the two.
rotten," You're thankful everything looks pretty because the plot mechanisms eventually become somewhat boring. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Sexual Content etc. - also Available)"
fresh," Tonally, it has elements of Ulrich Seidl at his cruellest and least forgiving, combined with a lurid B movie bombast."
fresh," Not surprisingly, the movie lives and dies on Steen's performance; not only is she in almost every frame, but at times, the camera is in so close that nothing is visible but her pitted, ravaged face."
fresh," Guileless and charming with a perpetual look of startled bewilderment at the super powers he possesses, Maguire is perfect as an ordinary guy with a big secret."
fresh," There's no ""force"", so you don't have to keep track of who's got the force and who's strong with the force. There's a good villain and a surprisingly heartfelt romance. But the heart of the film is the relationship between one man and his wookie."
rotten," While it is no hardship to gaze upon Gökhan Tiryaki's ravishing images of the landscape as its autumnal glow vanishes under an icy crust, there's not much to keep the intellect thrumming over the course of 196 minutes."
rotten," I stared at the screen wondering how anyone thought this could possibly have found an audience, even in the degraded '70s."
fresh," Arriving at a time when racial tensions in America are teetering on a knife's edge, Spike Lee's BlacKkKlansman could be the year's most important and relevant piece of cinema."
rotten," Even the smart ending feels predictable once it's happened: ""Move along,"" it seems to say, just like those New York cops. ""There's nothing to see here."""
fresh," It's got a remarkable visual texture, integrity to burn, and almost -- but not quite -- enough intelligence to justify its lofty ambitions."
rotten, The movie is both sloppy in its details and too literal in its thinking. A less blunt allegory might have made for sharper entertainment.
rotten, The film felt very anti-climatic to me for some reason.
rotten," Its intentions are honest, but the narrative strikes a false note at several key points."
rotten," Saves its best for last -- and God bless Maggie Smith for, well, being Maggie Smith -- but that requires sitting through a frustrating, uneven hour of sluggish preamble."
fresh," When Rogue One is following the ""cool and different"" edict, that's when it's awesome"
rotten," The film's animation design is strictly generic in its rounded edges and dutiful 3-D IN YOUR FACE!!! gimmicks. And the story gets off to such a sour start, it takes a long time for the comedy to recover."
fresh," Writer and director Jonathan Cenzual Burley...has captured the essence of rural Spain, in a close-knit village community and a small town"
rotten," As in McCarthy's slipshod road movies Identity Thief and Tammy, the material here isn't on her level, the laughs are largely cheap and once again, the hall-of-fame comic actress is stuck in a minor-league movie."
rotten, The screenplay plays like a character study of the most obvious.
rotten," The film drags at 91 minutes, filled with dead air that should be crackling with pulp energy."
fresh, Kidman's willingness to plumb the depths for her director elevates The Paperboy into something much more thrilling than the torrid settings from which it springs.
rotten," ...I don't know how much the LAPD pays it's officers, but I don't think it's enough to by a beautiful house in the hills."
fresh, Nicely amplifies George A. Romero's 1978 zombies-at-the-mall horror classic.
fresh," Juggling movie stars, plot points and a massive amount of visual effects, Whedon manages to put together a sequel that is fast and funny. But befitting the robot of the title, this feels more like a machine than a movie."
rotten," Burton, for all his skill, never ranges beyond the thrills of the obvious; he doesn't enlarge the meaning of the horror he shows us, the way a Brian De Palma might."
rotten," You'll recognize these characters and the wisdom they arrive at, but it's too bad our hero is such a deeply ethical square."
fresh," 'Get On Up' has Chadwick Boseman going for it, who is thoroughly convincing as the Godfather of Soul"
rotten," There are mildly progressive messages about diversity and appreciating inner beauty, in the unlikely event you buy into all of this nonsense in the first place."
rotten, A movie without a single memorable scene or quotable line.
rotten," ""Together, these young actors generate all the excitement of a laundry spin cycle. Thank God for Jeff Goldblum."""
fresh," Beautiful, affecting documentary about glacier retreat. "
fresh, ...depicts the bittersweet birth of musical genius.
fresh, Gives the premise a few twists that make things interesting.
fresh, Elle can brag about being one of the best films of the year. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten," From its swooping, acrobatic camerawork, to the fight scenes unfolding in eye-popping 3D, it's easy to see where the money has been spent."
rotten," The kids will like its simplicity and manic motion, but if you want more than that, you won't find it here."
rotten," Cynthia Roberts's film is poignant and courageous, but its curious status -- a film of a play that seems to want to be a documentary -- muffles its impact."
rotten, Life is pretty lifeless.
fresh," The story may be a trifle complex for very young viewers, but for most, Anastasia serves up a tasty tale about a fairy-tale princess."
rotten, This is derivative melodrama with Spielberg hedging his bets by ripping off his previous adventure films to lighten a story that cries out not to be turned into a comic book.
fresh, What seems an intimate drama between a poet tormented by the creative blockade and a young housewife who wants to conceive a child soon becomes a sort of home invasion thriller. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten," Hoodoo can't hurt you if you don't believe; unfortunately, it can't scare you either."
rotten, We have good performances but a very faulty script.
rotten, It's a shame that an initially fast-paced romp like this limps across the finish line.
rotten," This is a film with all the right ingredients, but in the end, it's a flavorless dish. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh," Has such a breezy, playful sense of despair about it... The appeal is very much its delicacy, both as magical realism love story and bleak story of broken people in a run-down community."
rotten," Reitman's ensemble drama tends to be too self-consciously mournful in its approach, overselling its message with far too much handwringing."
fresh," This grotesque, hyperstylized treatise on the fashion industry recaptures some of the zany images and B-movie abstractions of Refn's crossover effort, ""Drive,"" though it never quite gels on the same level of inspiration. "
rotten," Simply being dirty and gross is not the same as being funny, something the makers of this film apparently didn't understand."
fresh, Female anxieties and emotions spill over in a potent brew which effectively explores both sexual awakening and fear of the opposite sex.
fresh, I wonder if [director] Williams will tackle the rest of A Widow for One Year and bring us the whole John Irving story. He certainly did a fine job with part one.
fresh," A seething, swampy murder investigation infused with the sweaty smell of bodies and driven by a casual force that is seductively unstable, darkly funny and strangely exhilarating. Daniels is a visionary."
fresh," The last act of the film delivers in a shocking way. What comes before it is imperfect, but since we're talking about Nolan here, it's still worth seeing, discussing, and then seeing again."
rotten, Overrated and nauseating.
fresh," Hotel Transylvania 2 is far off from becoming a staple of the Halloween season, but on its own terms it's a relatively inventive, stylish, and somewhat hectic little movie that should make fans of the original more than happy."
rotten," McCarthy is always the life of the party, but this film is something of a drag."
fresh," It's one of the better Christmas films to come out in some time, and also one of the saddest ever made. "
fresh," Cronenberg is at play in this slippery, surreal affair that is best appreciated with open ears and an open mind -- and begs to be seen twice."
fresh," With a delirious mix of the sublime and the silly, Hong Kong comedy king Stephen Chow Sing-chi has taken the kung fu comedy genre to new heights of chop-socky hilarity."
rotten, A really dumb movie about aliens among us - but the two kid actors are great!
fresh," If this is not a film, by all means let us have many more such not-a-films."
fresh," It's a sensational picture, best received by minds open to generous cinematic brush strokes of right and wrong...undeniably thrilling on primitive, fist-clenching level."
rotten," In the background, Alexandre Desplat's swoony score piles on the sentiment, but it's all just empty calories; what this movie desperately needs is conflict."
rotten," It's as if director Raimi ingested a ton of Spidey comics, chased them with some crappy romance novels, and barfed the whole discordant mess onto the screen."
fresh," Simmons is a powerhouse of character development. You really believe that he's learning and coming around. It is touching to see a father and son connect, and there's some mild The Notebook sting when Gabriel forgets immediately. "
fresh," Star wars, indeed: The thrilling ""Rogue One"" brings a gritty combat-movie aesthetic to George Lucas's beloved space opera, but not at the expense of a thoughtful, emotional story about the foot soldiers who make sacrifices in the name of a movement. "
rotten," The movie struggles to find its footing, lacking the dramatic tension to make it of much interest beyond the fan base of the supremely talented, tragically fated Buckleys."
rotten," In Beginners, the Jack Russell terrier named Arthur proves to be damned cute. Unfortunately, the movie around him is not cute, it's coy."
fresh," Mel Gibson returns to the director's chair with the World War II drama Hacksaw Ridge, bringing his great gifts for epic filmmaking and his problematic tendencies."
fresh," All three ... leads are sensational, although their performances are so supply intertwined, it's hard to put a finger on exactly what each one is individually up to that's so good."
fresh, Anne Hathaway winds up stealing the whole film. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten, The performances and narrative flounder to strike the right balance between comedy and drama. 
rotten, Younger ... has no evident flair for comedy.
rotten," For all of its potential, the film falls short of the finish line -- unable to balance laughs with sentimental moments that sap out all of the comedic moments the cast worked so hard at achieving."
rotten," In the end, the whole clean-up project is as shrug-worthy as most of the ""Unrated Director's Cut!"" edits that go the other direction on home video, promising more nudity and gore but changing little of consequence."
fresh, By far the year's best American movie.
rotten," Scoop isn't going for complexity. It's a trifle. Like its rootless vaudevillian magician, however, it feels neither here nor there."
fresh, The Last Jedi should be the last Jedi. My interest died along with Hans Solo who took with him that cowboys in space humor that made the franchise so special. 
fresh," The great strength of the film is that it never resorts to cheap sentimentality. The facts themselves are hard enough, crushing enough."
rotten," A long, uninvolving, miscast (is Cameron Diaz really Steve Martin in drag?) chick flick, despite exceptional performances by Kate Winslet and two captivating little scene-stealers, Mifty Englefield and Emma Pritchard."
rotten," Here's that J. Edgar Hoover biopic you asked for, or at least something that meets all the technical requirements to be considered one."
rotten," What kills the movie ... is the script. That's strange, because it was known for years as one of the industry's best unproduced screenplays."
fresh," Alternately heavy-lidded and wide-eyed, Shannon has the coiled potential of a venomous snake...he paints a portrait of paranoia and fear with great skill."
rotten," Nine years after the first Rush Hour and a whopping six years after Rush Hour 2, the buddy chemistry between Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker is finally showing signs of fatigue."
fresh, Sean Penn's first masterpiece as a director.
rotten," A smorgasbord of pornography masquerading as violence, Everly is so repugnant and pointless there were times when I wanted to call for help."
fresh," Chadwick Boseman is so formidable that, were the film itself just a bit better, he would eventually be basking in the same sort of year-end accolades that greeted Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles and Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash. Who knows, he may yet."
fresh," Don't Breathe does a solid job of dispensing with dialogue in favor of driving the plot via strong, claustrophobic images as the camera snakes in and out of underlit rooms."
fresh," It's an engrossing, sometimes quite moving story..."
fresh," The film delivers the spectacle very well, but it also delivers some fine performances by Crowe, Connolly and Watson. This may not be your granddad's version of Noah, but it is quite a yarn, and thought-provoking, too."
rotten," If the Adam Shankman film's debasement of its subject into campy kitsch is the unavoidable fate of all culturally dangerous art, that doesn't make it any less palatable."
fresh, A coming-of-age film that finds poetry in the struggle to evolve even while the rest of the world is falling down.
fresh," Nymph()maniac is a sly piece of anti-slut-shaming cinema aimed at demystifying female carnal desire. While the film is fiercely pornographic, it does not represent pornography per se."
rotten," A pathetic action-comedy from a guy who can't film action, featuring stars who have the chemistry of Play-Doh and a rock."
fresh," Riotously fun, wickedly raunchy, and surprisingly heartfelt."
rotten," a cleverly scripted film featuring fine actors doing solid work -- nothing more, nothing less."
rotten, This latest attempt to translate King's horrific talent into a movie interweaves ancient fright techniques with modern technology and winds up as Nintendoized Gothic.
fresh," No, I don't want no Skrull A Skrull is a guy that can't get no love from Kree Hangin' out the earthbound side Of an Accuser's ride Trying to holler at Fury"
fresh, Unchallenging-but-heartwarming.
rotten," It's just too bad in its rush to get small and cheeky, it didn't take stock more globally."
fresh," Goofily amusing for 85 minutes, and a fitting B-feature to the E.T. comedy ""Paul."""
rotten," A boring revamp, with dull 3D effects, insipid teenage protagonists and only sporadically scary outbursts of neck-biting, crucifix-wielding and staking through the heart."
fresh," McNamara makes a very human monster, a flawed man who regrets that ""in order to do good you have to be willing to do evil."""
rotten, District is too fixated on earnest lessons against right-wing measures to ghettoize crime-ridden districts -- a message pertinent to modern-day Paris but which rings a tad hollow in a film that gleefully serves up gangland shootouts.
fresh, It keeps the essence of the original while adding a new sense of freshness. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten," It is a bland, clawless comedy; a cautionary tale of a high concept gone horribly, horribly wrong."
rotten," Without any real conflict, there's enough story here for 45 minutes to an hour, after which the filmmakers pad it with a brief history of Journey pre-Pineda and scenes from the tour and Pineda's new life; a passable feel-good doc, but not very memorable."
rotten," A too-long, one-note affair, predictably following the patterns of any fish-out-of-water comedy you can think of."
fresh, 'Halloween' offers more camp than creepiness.
rotten, Those who complain about the feeble jokes and contrived situations should be forced to watch the first two films and defend them.
rotten," Confused, heavy-handed and sappy, this is a teen satire without teeth, plagued by bizarre story choices and ironically robust earnestness, resulting in a comedy with only few glancing blows on its intended targets."
rotten," Putting an interracial love story on screen may have been bold in 1967, but by now it should be more casual than it is. The skittish, focus-grouped blandness of Guess Who comes through in the flavorlessness of the romance."
rotten," [I]t becomes clear that Parker has become stymied by his self-imposed, if admirable, restrictions."
rotten," For a franchise with an off-the-charts nuanced thinker as its protagonist, Alex Cross isn't very smart."
rotten," The film loses the rhythm set by the previous ones, it feels dragged and sometimes nothing happens. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh," The movie, not to mention the company, deserves praise for showing the challenges as well as the triumphs; ""Dior and I"" doesn't shy away from conflicts when they arise. This isn't marketing material. It's a real look at a fascinating line of work."
rotten, The worst Superman movie since 1987's Superman IV: The Quest for Peace...
rotten," Although there are moments when it feels the plot might move in unexpected directions, in the end, the expected cliches reign."
rotten," Another month, another teen vampire flick."
fresh," It's certainly more entertaining than the dour, dull Terminator Salvation and I found myself at least having fun with Genisys much of the time."
rotten," ...an R-rated fairy tale with...technology as magic. While 'Chappie' is easy to love, his film fails to elicit the same emotion."
fresh, An intriguing portrait of a man and a time that changed everything.
fresh," It's an exemplary comic book fantasia. There's plenty of CGI to go around here too, but Favreau uses it, for the most part, to enhance rather than supplant the movie's physical dimension."
rotten, American Assassin jarringly interposes scenes of hyper-realistic violence with the sort of half-hearted storytelling one expects out of a movie of the genre with minimal ambitions.
fresh," Still, kudos to Hathaway for taking a punt on something so ambitious, and credit especially to Sudeikis (We're the Millers, Horrible Bosses), who proves a revelation. Sometimes it really does pay to go big or go home."
fresh," Voice from the Stone is a strange, slow-burning supernatural thriller."
fresh, Plummer's real-life Scrooge McDuck portrayal of Getty is the movie's highlight.
rotten, Anon ends up feeling like a cheerless retread of Minority Report.
rotten, Really there's no amount of forced levity that can make this movie seem all right. 
rotten," For a movie that has been praised for its sensitive realism, Nico and Dani takes some large liberties."
rotten, One of the issues is that Lespert provides little insight into Saint Laurent's creative genius.
rotten," Downey and Galifianakis [are] flailing at every turn trying to make something out of really played-out, limp material. "
rotten," The corporate manipulation remains the same. However, Planes does possess the fluid animation ""Cars"" lacked, taking to the sky with a slick presentation of aerial balletics and cartoon antics. "
rotten, Woody Allen hits a new narcissistic low...
fresh, Wiseman knows that you don't have to take sides in order to make relevant cinema.
fresh," A shrieking, stylish throwback to classic creeping psychological horror."
fresh, It has a few marvelous tricks up its sleeve with extra doses of zoom-zoom.
rotten," Anderson is still a solid talent, but he should remember to explore his ideas in depth as well as breadth."
rotten, Its humor tires not too long after the beginning credits have finished rolling.
rotten," It's over long before it's over, by the time you start wishing that a few of the dogs from ""Best in Show"" would show up; a one-note comedy, pounded with a hammer and left flat."
rotten," As a movie, it has all the life of a boxed pink taffeta sample at Bergdorf that never leaves the stockroom."
rotten," Historians now agree that Barnum wasn't the one who said ""There's a sucker born every minute,"" but it's hard to escape the feeling that you're being sold a poptimist bill of goods here."
fresh, ...charming and enchanting and adventurous and romantic and funny and hugely entertaining.
rotten," The actual plot is thin to the point of absurdity, much of it hinging on the aliens stumbling on an Earth infomercial and conceiving the desire to buy a certain kind of vibrating mat."
rotten, The result is both earnest and passionless.
rotten, It does spend an awfully long time idling in the sidings.
rotten," While it's not aggressively bad, it is vapid and unimaginative, the type of thing you'd let the kids watch on TV for free, not in theaters for an arm and a leg."
fresh," A slow-burning story of regret and redemption, this is film of moments; most fleeting, a few intriguing, one outstanding."
rotten, ...the movie's failure [is] especially disappointing given the enduring success of 1997's Gattaca.
rotten," In watching Yours, Mine & Ours, you have to wonder what the director had against star Dennis Quaid."
fresh, Eastern Promises feels more like the first half of a character-driven epic than a film capable of standing on its own.
rotten, Twice as overstuffed with effects as its predecessor but less than half as entertaining...a sequel so dispiriting it almost makes one ashamed to have liked the first movie.
fresh," Turistas is, surprising, given its lousy marketing campaign and thankless release date, a solidly visceral piece of work. Socialized healthcare never sounded so good."
rotten," Long, unfocused and too often plagued by the curse of the biopic."
rotten, In a relatively solid film there's something that doesn't just fit. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh," The ILLUSIONIST is a hypnotic film that is an act of stage magic in itself. This is a captivating and atmospheric tale that will keep the viewer wondering what is real, what illusion."
rotten, Southside With You is a hagiography tormented by the truth.
fresh," It's beautiful, obsessed with surfaces, and drenched in blood, and the results couldn't be more striking."
rotten, The live-action adaptation is just as forgettable and inconsequential as the anime was memorable and influential. 
rotten, Wanderlust takes its aim at some very broad targets so it's no wonder that the film's jokes tend to be blunt and obvious rather than rapier-sharp.
fresh, Emotive and inspiring documentary about the creative process of artists with Down Syndrome. [Full Review in Spanish]
fresh," Zhang Yimou may have dipped his cinematic pen in mere genre, but in doing so, he has inscribed a masterpiece."
fresh, Watching Hoffman and Thompson tentatively discover each other is joyously tender.
rotten," Our heroic would-be victims take too long to like, too long to catch on, and are ultimately forgettable... This monster arrives in theaters promising too little, too late."
rotten, Director Dexter Fletcher shoves inspiration down your throat until you gag or give in. 
rotten, The Killing of A Sacred Deer isa mechanically savage slice of cinema that feels so obvious in its intentions that is starting to feel tired at this point.
rotten, What a waste of a perfect cast.
fresh," Neatly constructed, heartfelt triumph-over-adversity pictures have their place. This one is particularly sly in the way it folds complex and sometimes painful ideas about love and commitment into a somewhat glossy package."
rotten," In trying to respect every character's point of view, Hood doesn't reveal enough about any of them to make us truly care."
fresh," A well-mounted, well-acted and sporadically engrossing historical romance that isn't quite as magical as it wants to be."
fresh," The first half's a blast, but as the comedy / action / horror / parody piles up, Hot Fuzz cools down. Needs more of a short, sharp schlock."
fresh, Thirteen is a high impact psychodrama about three lost souls desperately reaching out for life preservers in a sea of troubles.
fresh," A hybrid of crime drama and neo-western..., Hell or High Water uses its half-breed genre thrills to expose an American dream long since soured by recession, and running on empty"
fresh," Even is you're not a fan of the time and its music, Brothers of the Head is fascinating to watch as the makers build a convincing mockumentary"
fresh," This is a beautifully animated, cleverly executed, warm and funny adventure."
fresh," Evan Almighty may not be enough to make you shout 'Hallelujah,' but it's not the cinematic equivalent of a plague, either."
fresh," Like a campy cross of Dr. Strangelove and Wag the Dog, this celluloid anti-war screed serves up a mesmerizing melange of action, romance, slapstick, intrigue, sentimentality and sensuality while warning of the dire prospects of a corporatized planet."
rotten," The costumes astound, the sight gags abound, but the heart, oh the heart, now that must be found."
rotten, A straightforward revenge drama with added gore.
rotten," Sorry, mis amigos, wrong decades. The modern B-movie would seem to be devoted to self-conscious fun. More laughs, but fewer real chills."
rotten, At least it might work as inspiration for DIY film-makers to prove they could do better.
fresh, The Boss can be a very flawed movie while still being hilarious.
rotten," There's a fascinating story here for a bolder filmmaker, but after so much meandering it's a relief that All Good Things must come to an end."
rotten," It's what would happen if Nicholas Sparks rewrote ""Groundhog Day"" as a teen-angst melodrama. "
rotten, [A] cloying road/buddy flick.
fresh," Featuring a mesmerizing central performance by Ben Dickey, ""Blaze"" avoids the clichés of the traditional biopic, instead creating a mood piece that feels like living inside one of Foley's songs, in all its beauty and sadness."
fresh," It's a cri de coeur that hardly rises above a sociable interjection, an exhortation to collective revelry that leaves a sense of uneasily imposed, even quasi-martial, paces."
rotten," This is a muzzled beast of an epic, all its sharp, strange edges blunted, its askew angles righted."
fresh," Oh yeah, it's that good, in that shivery, transporting way that makes you wonder how flickering images viewed in the dark can be so damn powerful."
rotten, Not a saga told with subtlety.
fresh, At times felt almost like a live-action version of one of Brigg's stories. 
rotten," The movie too often resembles a repetitive cycle of tough guys shouting, shooting and shuffling off this mortal coil."
rotten," Its own pointlessness may keep The Dirt from feeling like an actual affront to humanity, but that doesn't make it very good, either."
rotten," This might sound like a line from a movie review on The Onion, but: I would have thought ""executive produced by James Cameron"" meant something."
rotten, The images are sharp even when the film's ideas are not.
rotten," An anti-abortion movement propaganda screed masquerading as a teen angst drama. All that's missing are the religious right pamphlet tables in the theater lobbies. There's apparently a new kind of female road movie out there, called the guilt trip."
fresh, A compelling look at how one newspaper defied a government in order to fulfill its role as an investigative voice for the people.
rotten," Dick and Jane are fun enough, just not nearly as much fun as they should have been. This is a comedy that's all about the message. It needed to be more about the laughs."
fresh," By the end of The Spectacular Now, you're not quite ready to let these characters go."
rotten," Stars' chemistry can't save uninspiring, cliched comedy."
fresh, Not since Rocky brought Silvester Stallone to virtually instant stardom has there been a more effective attempt to repeat the phenomenon.
fresh, Kenneth Branagh's lavish live-action telling of the folktale made familiar to many by Disney's 1950 animated feature film is a faithful take that derives pleasure in updating expectations and absolutely never dashing them.
fresh," Uma ótima releitura da série de tevê, o filme traz Carell em momento inspiradíssimo."
rotten," While it almost takes on a campy air, distasteful subject matter prevents it from being little more than exploitative nonsense."
fresh," It re-creates the mood of an era, a nation's frustration and anger, all while rollicking along with a crackling adventure."
rotten," England and France in the 13th century, a time of injustice and mud. It's the same message one can garner about feudal society from MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL in less time and with a great deal more entertainment value."
fresh," Perhaps the reason for the film's acceptance in rock 'n roll 'insider' circles is its ultimately affectionate vibe. Reiner obviously loves his leather-jacketed bunch, even as they walk into one land mine after another."
fresh," the film's overall effect is undeniable, not only on the history of cinema as a whole, but in each new viewing that reveals another dimension or additional detail, the sum total of which is one of the true cinematic masterpieces"
rotten, This mash-up is just a big old mess-up. 
fresh," The film has an alluring lexicon of moods: luminous, glossy, animalistic, pastoral. If not for the trail of corpses left behind, this might be reminiscent of other dreamy European coming-of-age narratives."
rotten," By mid-film, American Pastoral has all the anticipation of watching water circling around a drain that quickly disappears."
rotten, An Eastern movie made to resemble the most unchallenging Western ideal of what the East is.
fresh, Both grimly funny and thought-provoking.
fresh, Joaquin Phoenix gives another incredible performance in this excellent new film from Gus Van Sant. The actor is a true chameleon and always believable.
fresh," A worthy, overdue tribute to a group of intrepid, World War II heroes who never let their second-class status diminish their patriotism even one iota. "
fresh," As rich, fulfilling and complex as a traditional Indian meal."
rotten, Amazing that Ang Lee can make such a listless movie about arguably one of the most high energy times in recent history.
fresh," This is a good-looking film, and Jackson is just so much fun to watch. The other horror films that are out there? This one's a slither above them all."
fresh," All three stars deliver exactly what you expect from them -- nothing more, nothing new -- but their onscreen familiarity is a strange comfort in itself."
fresh, The art of living in defiance of goodbye
rotten, Watchable but empty
rotten," Packs an emotional punch, but that only partly makes up for the lack of a good story"
fresh, Some documentaries are designed to give information. Winged Migration provides pure sensation -- and it's sensational.
fresh," Original and idiosyncratic, it's a quirky glimpse of imaginative innocence."
rotten, Feels almost unbearably cruel and cynical. 
fresh," A solid filmmaker who delivers nearly flawless pictures, Clint Eastwood is in fine form with Million Dollar Baby."
fresh, It's also a fairly entertaining children's story. But for kids? Let's say it's a film for Wes Anderson.
rotten, Perhaps you'll be too distracted by the industrial-chic office space to notice that laughs are in short supply. 
fresh," The joy of Intolerable Cruelty is in watching Clooney deconstruct his suave screen persona, that mix of Cary Grant cool and Dean Martin hip, in front of your very eyes."
rotten," This is a negative five. This is probably the worst movie of the year...it's so bad, halfway through the movie, I wondered if I was in a Jacob's Ladder scenario..."
rotten," Leaving aside the galloping misogyny, 'Rock the Kasbah' just isn't remotely funny or smart."
rotten," Sorority Row proves to be just another crass slasher movie, recycling familiar ingredients to diminishing effect."
fresh, Diane Lane and John Cusack have such terrific chemistry together in the genial romantic comedy Must Love Dogs that it's a wonder these two veteran performers have never been teamed before.
fresh," It may not be the most realistic portrayal of drug addiction ever produced, but it's certainly worth seeing - if for nothing else than Downey's superlative performance."
fresh," Absurd and stupid but fabulously entertaining, crafted with steadfast commitment to seeing that stupidity through to its conclusion."
rotten, Nearly everything about this film is a cliché.
rotten," The whole world loves these characters, and so much time, effort and money has been hurled at this property. But the story in Justice League is practically non-existent -- and, even more insulting, the big Hollywood special effects look like garbage."
fresh, Elstree 1976 serves as a relevant Star Wars companion for fans big and small.
fresh, ...a serviceable and nostalgic coming-of-age kiddie comedy that resonates...has enough heart and soul to capture the giddy delight of its festive confines.
rotten," Filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low. Fortunately for all involved, this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water."
fresh," From first shot to last, the Coens seldom miss an opportunity to suggest that theirs is a movie made by evolutionarily advanced life-forms touring a primitive planet."
rotten, The end result still gives every appearance of the film having been made up as they went along.
fresh," Draggy, but compelling, if you've read the book."
rotten," While the violent sequences are very effectively staged, the results are a strange hybrid that doesn't quite work."
rotten, The second half of Grown Ups isn't good enough to dig its way out of the tremendous hole it's created for itself but it's far from the worse thing Sandler has ever made. Maybe in another 20 years he'll make something funny.
rotten," It's not that ""Runner Runner"" is predictable. It's that you don't care, either about the characters or what happens to them."
rotten, Took a premise rife with potential and created perhaps the most boring story possible to accomodate the two sci-fi races.
fresh, Karloff manages to invest the character with some subtleties of emotion that are surprisingly real and touching.
fresh," For those who have the patience to become absorbed in this kind of drama, Vera Drake offers a stunningly real character portrait whose image will linger long after the movie has faded."
rotten," Meirelles has crafted a lurid, even hysterically visual, but dramatically trite and obvious approximation of whatever was intended by Saramago."
rotten," There is a lot to be said about the futility of war, and now Dutta has made his case for the futility of the war movie."
fresh, Visually witty and even marvelous when it comes to depicting the spectacular creatures.
rotten," Any momentum is swallowed up by its failed attempts at being smarter than everyone in the room, which isn't exactly a good way to keep an audience invested."
fresh," Good action sequences will satisfy the adrenaline junkies and lots of throwbacks to Terminator films of yore will make the Terminator fans happy. There are actually parts of a good movie in here, but the focus is in the wrong place."
rotten," ""Sex and the City"" fashion porn married to The Princess Diaries 'tween ugly-duckling uplift."
fresh," This has more bite than we've come to expect from Sam Raimi's Ghost House production outfit. Some of the action misses the jugular, but Danny Huston makes for a sensational baddie."
rotten," Indeed, the darknesses pile up on one another with such an alarming rate (Murders! Strokes! Secrets!), the tone of the entire film shifts from one of illicit sexual naughtiness to downright death-obsessed Gothic melodrama."
fresh," This sequel turns out to be a comedy of manners, of all things, and an agreeable one, a movie that will get you laughing and suck you in."
fresh, Leaves you cheering as you dab your eyes with a Kleenex.
fresh, ...give[s] you some sense of what it must have been like a literary/journalistic star in the 1960s. 
rotten," There is a good movie inside of Batman v Superman, which makes it all the more frustrating that the stuff the movie gets wrong, it gets really wrong."
fresh, A movie with an impressive photography surrounding an epic drama. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten," If you relish the sight of a healthy male body being systematically demolished, beyond the farthest reach of plausible endurance, The Passion of the Christ is your movie."
fresh," A superior work of confrontational boldness, it might be the movie Oppenheimer wanted to make in the first place."
rotten," There's plenty of talk about American Sins in American Assassin, but none of it changes the fact that the bad guys want to do bad things and must be stopped, so there really isn't much point to all that chatter."
fresh," Anderson is at the middle of point of his life, considering the uncertainty of the world."
fresh," Not the best Bond, but not the worst either."
fresh," This Internet-promoted lark about a Hawaii-to-L.A. flight besieged by a frenzied tangle of snakes is hilariously funny, full of fang-popping scares, and guaranteed to increase travel by train."
rotten," Dull and programmatic in equal measure, The Ones Below seeks to thrill with its Polanski-tinged pregnancy drama but mostly ends up insulting its audience's intelligence with an obvious endgame and cheap stabs at paranoid dread."
rotten," The dialogue is sci-fi standard-issue, composer Marco Beltrami shamelessly cribs from Bernard Herrmann, and wispy Rose Byrne barely registers as Cage's ally."
fresh, The Coen's survey of American mythology hits every note.
rotten," It is at all times mysteriously, transcendentally boring."
rotten, Third in 'Hotel Transylvania' franchise is a better-than-average stay.
fresh," The film captivates with its inspired triumphs, sweet romance and utterly heartbreaking tragedy. "
fresh," A visually and aurally stunning film that brings viewers up close and very personal with several ""big cat"" families - as well as a dazzling array of other safari-esque species - living in Kenya's sprawling Masai Mara National Reserve."
rotten, Go in with low expectations.
fresh," There's something indomitable about her will to perform, and insecurity has been part of her experience for decades, it's clear."
rotten," Higher Ground is a weird film with some very nice moments, but its odd and offbeat combination of comic touches, serious spiritual subject matter and occasional surrealist interludes never quiet gels."
rotten," Not boring, exactly, but undeniably tedious."
fresh," The perfect blend of black humor, The Death of Stalin has a very real message about the political world today. "
fresh," Unfortunately, the movie falls short of an ""A"" grade because director James Mangold and his co-writer Gil Dennis don't make you understand what Carter sees in Cash."
fresh," Not just one of the more entertaining Marvel movies - infinitely better than Joss Whedon's overstuffed Avengers: Age of Ultron - but a genuinely fun and clever deconstruction of the genre, too."
rotten," Bake a 'Men In Black' pie; throw in some 'Ghostbusters,' 'This Is the End,' 'True Grit,' and 'Weeds,' drain the fun out, and you get the half-baked, derivative 'R.I.P.D.'"
rotten, Those expecting the exuberance of an Erin Brockovich from the same producers will be disappointed. Extraordinary Measures is sensitive and dull.
fresh, The Long Kiss Goodnight is a surprisingly witty action-comedy.
rotten," Other than its campy title, not much about Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is fun."
fresh," Casting Isaac... is Chandor's masterstroke. This is a star-making performance: self-assured and light on its feet. In a fairer world, Abel Morales would be sharing espresso and a cannolli with Michael Corleone."
rotten, An all-round flimsy scripts undermines what was at one point this year one of the most anticipated sci-fi films of 2016.
fresh, An engaging comedy drama lifted by two revelatory performances. Wiig in particular suggests an Academy Award-winner-in-waiting.
rotten," Looking For Eric is not so much a game of two halves as a chaotic kickabout, in which the rules of the game keep changing. It will score with some people but, I confess, I was looking for more."
rotten, When was it decided superhero movies shouldn't be any fun?
rotten," Wayne Blair and Jessica Sharzer's remake attempts to be all things to all people, and ends up being nothing to anybody."
rotten, That I consider Apocalypto to be Gibson's best film as a director really isn't such high praise when you consider the fact that I hated his last two movies and have only dim memories of his first.
fresh," Raw, and real, and profoundly, indelibly moving."
rotten, 'Hook' and 'Finding Neverland' at least seemed to know what Peter Pan was about. 'Pan' feels like Any Blockbuster remade as Peter Pan. 
rotten," Nothing's particularly risky or original, but neither is anything all that repulsive."
rotten," Clearly, this movie is designed to sell action figures rather than make sense."
rotten, We are strictly going through the motions here folks
fresh," The closing images-of a self-annihilating, all-consuming passion that will be preserved for centuries-[obliterate] the line between the ridiculous and the sublime."
fresh," Not all the scenes are necessary, and a great deal of the movie is set-up, with Jackson reveling in his own return to Middle Earth. But it's an enjoyable experience."
fresh, Darkly comic culture clash wish-fulfillment fantasy that turns from twee to ugly realism in a heartbeat. 
fresh, Chicago's so engrossing that you even forget to reach out for the Coke n' popcorn. Now isn't that entertainment!
rotten, An explicit shot of a penguin doing its business on a man's face [is] an apt metaphor for what the movie has to offer family audiences.
rotten," This is a grating, sometimes very violent comedy-thriller that suffers from a chronic identity crisis. The film can't work out whether it's a slacker romance or an all-action spy movie in the Manchurian Candidate mode."
fresh," It's about the gradual wakening into awareness, the graduation from carefree youth to responsible adulthood."
rotten," Just as Broomfield's latest points a harsh light on those who profited from her death, so too does he stray into their territory, giving a broken woman one final humiliation."
rotten, The Man Who Killed Hitler and Then the Bigfoot is lacking in one area that proves to be quite detrimental for a film with such an outlandish title - it's just not fun.
fresh," As both a valentine to new love and Hong Kong's Cantonese cosmopolitanism, it's a breezily enjoyable and heartfelt travelogue."
fresh," The fight scenes between Blade and the vampires are some of the best-choreographed in recent memory, this side of Hong Kong."
fresh," Dawn of the Dead is ultra-violent, excessively bloody, and extremely gory - all in a good way. I left the theater feeling pumped full of adrenaline."
rotten," Any dolt could fill a movie with sickening stuff, and there's nothing scary, funny or interesting about what Cronenberg has done. It is just tedious and insulting. Get the swatter."
fresh," At moments, under burnished yet offhanded light, ""The Rover"" is literary machismo of a high order. And at others? We're watching Michelangelo Antonioni's ""Mad Max."" (This is not a bad thing.) "
fresh, Yakin executes the touching material with the expected serviceability.
fresh, I was held by Depp's transformation from white-man non-entity to the Jarmusch version of the affectless Man With No Name.
rotten," The leads are appealing, the material familiar -- it adds a Front Page romantic angle to The Devil Wears Prada, and reworks ideas from Green Card."
rotten, The pacing is so slow and the religious undertones so heavy that only Jesus himself could rise above the draining weight.
fresh, A rare film when the random elements of filmmaking align in a formula equaling near-greatness.
rotten," One of the least convincing, most manipulative films ever made about the everyday struggles of the developmentally disabled."
rotten," [Harris is] the one good thing in ""Natural Selection."""
rotten, Lucky You undoes what Rounders did right.
fresh," Its strangeness and repetition may turn some away, but on both a technical and thematic level, it is a work to be celebrated."
fresh, Star Trek is the first great blockbuster of the year and is undoubtedly a bona fide masterpiece in the family genre.
rotten, Nina teaches us an important lesson about waiting for a film to come out before criticizing it. For it is only then that we can know how truly heinous it is.
fresh, Elle makes a strong case for the actress as auteur. 
fresh, An exercise in briny Welsh Weltzschmerz that tracks the inner and outer worlds of a confused teenage boy.
fresh," Why should second-rate scripting be a concern? Because Hedge can be ruthlessly entertaining when it wants to be, and that isn't nearly enough."
fresh," On a Gauge of 1 to 10, it's a terrific, triumphant 10 - one of the most ambitious, exciting animated features ever made."
rotten," Shattered. Broken. Cracked. Insert whichever pun you choose. Personally, this is one piece of glass I won't want to be looking at ever again."
fresh," There is much promise here from the young director, Greg Harrison."
fresh," The visuals in Atomic Blonde pop right off the screen. Leitch periodically zooms in for tight close-ups of the stunning Theron, who conveys a world of emotions with a subtle movement of the eyes."
rotten, Michael Haneke's run of making increasingly better films has come to an abrupt halt.
fresh, The intersection of three masters of their craft has resulted in a magnificent treatment on the perennial subject of lying for gain.
fresh," [A] smarter, sharper, funnier, wiser story than I ever could have expected... [I]t reinforces what we love about superheroes and why we embrace them... And yes, still, Megamind really is all about the villain."
fresh," Taken for what it is, a crowd-rousing summer blockbuster inspired by a children's mechanical toy, Michael Bay's Transformers is some kind of mess...terpiece."
fresh," An expertly paced, technically audacious thriller that's too knowing to be easily dismissed as a mere exercise."
fresh," Another mildly pleasant mix of malapropisms and pop culture references, diaper humor, snippets of rock classics, a little adventure, pleasant for the kids and not too painful for their parents."
fresh, Shows how a movie with no budget can still thrill.
fresh," The Devil Wears Prada is two films in one: a caustic, energetic satire of the fashion world and a cautionary melodrama."
fresh, ...lovely and slight
fresh," There are many echoes of Anderson's earlier films, particularly Rushmore and Tenenbaums. He's an unapologetic romantic and Moonrise Kingdom is a study in wish-fulfillment. "
rotten," [A] tepid, incompetent biopic."
fresh," ""The Rum Diary"" exudes a cheery, beery sense of warmth and affection."
fresh, Overall ... Buffalo Boys delivers on its initial promise of a thrilling tweak to familiar tropes.
fresh, Wheatley remains a master of infusing the mundane with overtones of dread.
fresh, There is nothing like this dame when she plays a queen. Judi Dench shines again in a surprising royally entertaining tale from the great Stephen Frears.
fresh, The Limehouse Golem is wildly over the top. That's precisely what it is meant to be - and what gives the drama such a kick.
rotten," It's a nice change of pace to find a sequel that doesn't merely try to remake the original, but Babe: Pig in the City lacks any of the original's endearing gentle spirit."
fresh," It is, of course, an ensemble piece and the entire cast brings it together with skill and style under Parker's skillful direction."
rotten, This 4th film in the saga directed by Bryan Singer is a big let down. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten," ...Bennett, a prolific character actress, deserves a much better starring vehicle than this."
fresh," ABSCAM comes alive in this stereotype drenched, pratfall ridden but entertaining story of good people lost in the American promise."
rotten," Spacey's wretched, agonizing, tone-deaf version of the Darin story."
rotten, Taking offense to a film about tolerance just because it's aimed squarely at Middle America is itself intolerant. Chuck and Larry's crime is it doesn't maintain its most audacious bits and it's never funny enough.
fresh, This year's Winter's Bone?
rotten, Is the fish fresh?...Shark Tale believes it can foist off high-speed energy in the place of wit.
rotten," Spike Lee's incendiary farce is too uneven to recommend, but its uncanny timing and sense of outrage are worth noting."
rotten," At one point, someone marvels at Calvin's sheer ""lust for life,"" and while Mr. Schroeder, no doubt, has a parallel fascination with his favorite comic strip, the film doesn't follow through."
fresh," The irony of Florence Foster Jenkins, the ghastly soprano, was that she was such a crowd-pleaser. Fittingly, so is the film."
rotten, A hollow fabrication in the pursuit of someone's sick idea of redemption. I didn't pay to see it... but I want my wasted time back.
fresh," A surprisingly enjoyable, fitfully entertaining romp for all the family, with a satisfying gag count."
fresh, Impactante justamente por evitar se concentrar nos poderosos que se encontram no topo da hierarquia da camorra.
rotten," [Downey] gives Iron Man 2 its fascination. The rest is a cluttered, clattering toy story."
rotten," Even a lively electronic score by M83, a bustling Imax presentation and Cruise at his most action-pic watchable can't make this inert film come to life."
rotten," Snowpiercer is leaden and confused, an all-star disaster of a movie, of interest only to connoisseurs of expensively botched sci-fi money-pits."
fresh," Offers a terrific role for Garcia, as a desperate man who keeps erasing and redrawing the boundaries of his conscience."
rotten, Kurt & Courtney wasn't well received upon its release and 20 years later it fares no better.
rotten, Will engage your little ones minimally while in the theaters but will leave them without any desire to get the DVD later in order to see it again.
rotten, A mediocre urban thriller.
rotten," Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice will probably please those who just want to see their comic book heroes come to life in a visually stunning way, but it will frustrate anyone looking for substance."
fresh," With its sprung rhythms and pop sensibility, Wong Kar-wai's genuinely inspired pastiche of early Godard and late Hitchcock could be dismissed as another bit of stylishly pomo navel-gazing -- if it weren't so obviously about something."
rotten," The film becomes conventional, collapsing between an ocean of myths that do not matter to anyone, spliced with a few sequence of Indiana Jones-esq adventure. [Full Review in Spanish] "
rotten," Everyone needs love and a home, whether kids or animals, is the cheesy but entirely heartfelt message of this fairly predictable and old-fashioned kids' movie."
rotten," As with his last biopic, Pinero, director Leon Ichaso has a way of both dwelling on the most sensationalistic aspects of a genius' life while obscuring the importance and meaning of their work."
rotten, Nothing but one big chase scene...It plays as if robots even wrote the script -- and stupid robots at that.
rotten," It is a tired retread that offers little new or original, taking 007 to the one place he's arguably never been before: irrelevance."
fresh," Exhausting, in the visceral, adrenal way a good adventure should be. Comparing 'War of the Worlds' and this particular 'Kong,' Peter Jackson out-Spielbergs Steven Spielberg."
rotten," Although the material is lightweight, it is a cute, amusing film."
rotten, ...trickier than it appears - and far too tricky for first-time director Ben Affleck.
fresh," If we were to reduce all of world cinema to just a dozen images, Karina's perfect, pensive face would have to be among them."
rotten, Anyone except Young devotees may find this one a yawn-inducing experience.
fresh," Sparkling performances by McAdams, Ford, Keaton, and Goldblum, brilliantly directed by Michell from a terrific script by McKenna make for a thoroughly entertaining romcom."
fresh, The genius of the film lies in its combination of traditional Disney characters and situations with a very subversive storytelling style. 
rotten, Pretty long and unengaging...
fresh," Both Driver and Farahani draw us into this world of small stakes writ large, theirs a moving portrait of a living marriage, quirks and all."
rotten," It is quite impossible to set a film in the Paris catacombs and completely mess up the sense of grim, suffocating atmosphere... But do they come close."
fresh," ""Unstoppable"" is as good as its name. A runaway train drama that never slows down, it fashions familiarity into a virtue and shows why old-school professionalism never goes out of style."
fresh, Mean Girls does the 'wicked teen girl movie' subgenre justice.
fresh," It's a fine film, both as a music documentary and as a family story."
rotten," Although the sheer scale of this production is undeniably impressive, there's little grandeur or sweep to this would-be epic, which lacks both the visceral power and genuine pathos of Ridley Scott's Oscar winner Gladiator."
fresh," What we see is explosive, deeply moving and impossible to shake."
rotten," I left the theatre really and truly disappointed in THE PREDATOR. It ended up a bit of a shambling Frankenstein. Trying to serve too many masters, perhaps, and falling short of satisfying any of them."
fresh, Viewer patience gets rewarded with the meaningful twists in a powerful final act that lovingly defines what a real family is all about.
rotten," It's dull and conventional, turning a half-century of mischief into 80 minutes of yawns."
rotten," With only brief glimpses of a coherent film, Tale of Tales is a flat and overlong misfire."
rotten," There's a story of revenge here, along with some nods to the classic myths of Greek gods and goddesses, as well as a pretty spiffy concept for the Minotaur. Mostly, though, this is a bloodbath."
rotten," Sometimes keeping things as uncomplicated as possible can be an asset to a twisty, sparse thriller, but in the case of Transpecos that mindset is a major hindrance."
rotten, A picture in which every single element conspires to make it feel like a movie you rented one lonely Saturday night back in 1987 and immediately regretted.
fresh," Aside from his trademark visual style, Gilliam generally handles the chaos he depicts quite well, and he's come up with a marvelous cast."
fresh," Despite a recycled plot, and cop-out ending, film is a delightful charmer that works exceptionally well thanks to an endearing performance by Jennifer Garner."
rotten," Poorly written, poorly acted exercise in banality and studio greed."
rotten," Possibly the biggest, loudest, dumbest summer-movie opener in quite some time."
fresh," Through clever editing of many on camera and audio-only interviews, Walker is able to pull the audience back and forth, until no one is sure whether Daniel is telling the truth, or if he simply has grown to believe his own tall tales."
rotten," The movie is not only anti-capitalism but anti-society, and, indeed, anti-God."
rotten," This film, directed by Susanna Fogel, is a crass and vulgar spy caper with few admirable qualities, aside from the competent pairing of Kunis and McKinnon and one terrific laugh about the overwrought menu of a certain American restaurant chain. "
fresh," As before, it's a shameless mash-up of Poltergeist, Amityville etc, with added cattle-prod jumps."
fresh," This is real movie magic... We know they can create anything in CGI, make anything happen with tricky editing and the like. To actually take that out of an equation may not be obvious to everyone, but it registers."
rotten," Takes two steadfast horror tropes - demonic possession and the gimmick of ""found footage"" - and does very, very little new with them."
rotten," At any rate, with Spider-Man 3 hitting theaters next Thursday I don't need a crystal ball to foresee this one disappearing from theaters and hitting DVD in a matter of weeks."
fresh, Steve Carell and Tina Fey manage to be funny without ever seeming superior to the slipshod material.
rotten," For every joke that works, there are five that don't."
fresh, Justice for Dredd.
fresh, The real girls of Skate Kitchen make it work beautifully as a coming-of-age fictional film. The group's friendship and camaraderie translates naturally to the screen.
fresh," This movie is smarter and better acted and just plain funnier than most of its predecessors in the my-first-time genre, no matter which sex is losing what."
fresh," Una irresistible comedia romántica que desafía algunas convenciones del género, gracias a un tratamiento fresco y original, una deliciosa banda sonora y dos protagonistas perfectos."
fresh," Hopkins and Banderas are very different sorts of actors, and here, in very different ways, each pulls off his role expertly."
rotten," Beck ... is very good on volume but not much for tension, suspense or frightening anyone."
fresh," It's certainly more interested in ideas than characters, and the film stumbles when it makes half-hearted attempts at romantic intrigue or tragic backstories, but its subversive view of race, money and power in modern sports couldn't be more timely."
fresh," For The Post, the past is prologue. It's also a telling indictment of where we are today."
fresh," Prophecy and politics are intertwined in a realm where strange and beautiful imagery takes on dark meaning, and violence and male posturing rules all."
fresh," The film's a technical tour de force, with flawless stop-motion animation and some imaginatively realized live-action sequences. What's surprising here is how much of Dahl's misogyny is allowed to surface."
rotten," The action/competition scenes have some dynamism, but the overall look of the film is unimaginative."
rotten," Salman Khan may be a huge star, but this outdated comedy doesn't make the best of his abilities."
fresh, A wise film from head to toe. [Full Review in Spanish] 
rotten," If ""The Lord of the Rings"" was ancient legends sifted through the sensibility of an Oxford professor of Anglo-Saxon studies, then ""Thor: The Dark World"" is grand Norse myth run through the minds of 9-year-olds."
fresh," The most interesting aspects of this auto-biographical work in filmmaking terms is the storytelling style that Ari Folman has chosen, which enables him to show things like his dog nightmares as well as atrocities and violence in a way live action can not"
rotten," Even with the bar having been lowered by the vacuous, overblown prequels though, 'Clone Wars' takes things to crass new lows"
fresh, The supreme accomplishment in Mann's career.
fresh," It's nearly impossible to screw up a tale of friendship like this, with ""Belle and Sebastian"" hitting all the highlights of harmony and valor. Cute dog close-ups help too."
rotten," If it weren't for Streep, The Iron Lady would be unwatchable."
fresh, Mulholland Drive echoes with the ghosts of Hollywood past.
fresh," It is outstandingly watchable, superbly and casually pessimistic, a world of slot-mouthed professional and semi-professional criminals always complaining about cleaning up the mess made by other screwups."
rotten," She has too many exes. They should have stopped at four, because it just means these repetitive fights that are the same and they're all unbelievable and it becomes extremely tedious."
fresh," Nice looking and well acted, The Commune is afflicted by melodramatic tendencies that eventually overwhelm it. But there are rich dramatic moments, and Trine Dyrholm is exceptional."
rotten, Everyone involved with this film has something better than this on their resume.
fresh," We, as spectators, are witnesses of this freak-show of an unfortunate but talented redneck who had everything to win but who, in reality, was born to lose. (Review in Spanish)"
rotten," Seidl sternly rejects nuance. All the women are crude and insensitive, all the men are desperate and exploited."
rotten," While better than its predecessor, Beyond Skyline is still a sequel to a thinly conceived film, and even the freshest coat doesn't work to hide the issues underneath."
rotten," Too seldom clever, too often tiresomely busy, and wasteful of its voice cast, it's Hoodwinked that is the crime."
rotten," There are some laughs here, but not nearly enough to make this worth paying to see. (Full Content Review for Parents - Profanity, Nudity, Sex, etc. - also Available)"
rotten," The love triangle, which comes to overwhelm the second half, feels more like soap opera than anything else, and the able cast can't redeem DuVernay's often dreadful dialogue."
rotten," Can a video game turn a movie into a hit, man? Maybe. But that doesn't mean that ""Hitman"" is far removed from its video game origins."
fresh, Cyber-Seniors isn't just a window on an unlikely alliance of polar generations but also a celebration of discovery.
fresh," The questions posed by Hard Candy may not be as profound as the filmmakers believe, but they are enough to keep us thinking for the length of a movie that deftly uses exploitation to explore exploitation."
fresh, The actors keep the film from becoming too stupid
rotten, REALLY smart people will probably wait for the DVD release.
fresh," The visuals are gorgeous. The mood is unsettling from start to finish. ""Annihilation"" is a strong sophomore effort from a very talented filmmaker."
fresh," However fanciful the happy endings are (and there must always be happy endings in this type of production), thanks to McDormand and a sweet, snappy script we believe and celebrate every moment of them."
rotten," To properly convey the jaw-dropping shoddiness of this videogame-based 'horror' 'movie,' one must approach what scientists call Absolute Stupid."
fresh," A small, strangely sweet tale well told. But this is all about Mol, who puts in a performance that gives her a very early lead on next year's Oscar race."
rotten," Ships, planes and water combust and collide in Pearl Harbor, but nothing else does in one of the wimpiest wartime romances ever filmed."
rotten, Press the delete key.
rotten, Even an actress as good as Bisset can't do anything when her scene partner is so absent and the script is so one-dimensional.
fresh," It's when the investigation sorts out the knowable (what happened?) and then moves into the unknowable (why?) that ""Elah"" moves beyond genre and becomes one of the year's best films."
fresh, The film is both delicate and unforgettable.
rotten," As a result, Deep Impact seems mildly engaging, but, well, rather shallow."
fresh," The resounding message of ""drop what you're doing and get involved!"" is hardly original, but there are certainly points to be taken from all fronts."
rotten," There are half a dozen good laughs in ""Ride Along,"" but the movie could have used a few more, and a plot."
fresh," The film isn't always subtle, but a broad brush sometimes leaves behind a big, beautiful swath of color."
fresh, A good and decent film in a world that rather heartlessly demands more.
rotten," The picture has a knockabout charm, thanks to the actors; but its premise seems flawed."
fresh," It's an incisive portrait of a particular society, but it should resonate everywhere."
fresh," For all its lapses in grace and pacing, The Heartbreak Kid somehow manages to wear away resistance with the simple charms exhibited by its cast, including Akerman, whose sportsmanship is above and beyond the call of duty."
fresh, Very nice piece of work.
rotten, Though high-minded and well-intentioned - as well as being conceived on an epic scale - there's something faintly stodgy and safety-first about the endeavour.
rotten, When the sex is as boring as the story and the characters which inhabit it... all we can do is rejoice the entire endeavor is over fairly quickly.
rotten," To call this misty, low-risk collection of calculated revelations a high-toned The Bucket List would be a disservice to Rob Reiner."
fresh," It is filled with neurotic people in greasepaint, some charming, most amusing, and by the time you've spent an hour and a half with them, you're more than invested in their lives and cares."
rotten, Robin Williams and Billy Crystal can each provoke a lot more laughs in a minute of standup than they jointly manage during the entire running time of Fathers' Day.
fresh," With its never-seen footage and lots of great music, it can't help but be hugely entertaining."
rotten," Even blessed with an all-access pass, ShowBusiness is incapable of being considered anything besides a hooray-for-Broadway memento."
rotten," This is the kind of film you go to for only one reason: you're a teenager, you're on a date, and you're ready for an excuse to grip someone tightly."
rotten, McQueen always uses film pretentiously. Widows belongs to his edgy genre of queasy art projects masquerading as movies. 
rotten, Part of it delivers knock-out images and exquisite camerawork. The other part is just one big fish story.
rotten, Suffice to say this is so unengaging that you will find yourself rooting for the sharks and the jellyfish. 
fresh," Edgy Barrymore romcom has lots of sex, language."
fresh," Persistence has finally paid off with this frequently rebooted franchise - not only is this one of the most enjoyable ""Spider-Man"" movies to hit the big screen, it's one of the most dazzling animations of the year."
rotten," A sadistic, religiose French horror movie."
rotten," Cameron has fared better than most in wedding cutting-edge special effects with ... genre storytelling, but Avatar, his supremely goofy science-fiction/action spectacular, finds him lost in a $250 million aquamarine light show."
fresh," Gonzo, psychotic and deranged. And those are the best parts. "
rotten," Even Jim Carrey, whose mere presence can often liven up a film lacking in luster, can't save the almighty turkey that is ""Bruce Almighty."""
fresh," Stirring documentary about an unlikely politician, one who puts principles above personal gain."
rotten," Only the dog has a clue about when the ""Devil's Due."""
rotten," Meanwhile, explanations are offered, buildings collapse on themselves, DiCaprio frets moodily, henchmen fall over and that white van keeps falling off that bridge ... It's all very beautiful, and mostly very empty."
rotten," There are laughs, sure, with Brooks' unabashed moocher coming up with many of the film's best lines... but the overall results are distinctly patchy and at 133 minutes, the film is at least half an hour too long."
rotten," A tell-all chronicle about how this movie came into existence might be more compelling than the film itself, and require angry denials from authorities in response."
rotten, It seriously boggles the mind that Assassin's Creed can assemble so much talent and yet achieve so very little.
fresh," In the end, it's perhaps Mother Nature that gives the best performance; she's never been more majestic on film."
rotten, The very existence of this film illustrates barrel-scraping desperation of the Hollywood kind.
rotten," The storyline becomes pretty tedious, thanks to an incredibly slow beginning and a scenario based entirely on running around in circles to get away from the undead."
fresh," Filled with compelling, old-school thrills."
fresh," The wide-eyed, openhearted sincerity of the thing never slackens, and neither does its spirit of invention."
rotten," ""Dracula Untold"" is an artificial glorification lacking reason for the retelling. Even Dracula's wife outshines him in her supporting role."
rotten," Seems strident and combative, as though director Michel Franco was chuckling as we try to figure out what the movie was doing."
rotten, A textbook study in cinematic recycling -- everything in it seems to have been borrowed from other movies.
fresh," Mixing its political and personal themes with passionate urgency, A Family Tour somehow manages to convey desperation and hopefulness simultaneously."
fresh," [Boychoir] isn't quite an 'Inspirational Teacher Drama' (think Dead Poets Society), as it's more interested in family, how we nurture the gifts we're given, and the redemptive power of music."
fresh," I suspect the young'uns will...take a shine to the hero of Rango: a chameleon that's part Kermit the Frog, part street-corner kook (and all Johnny Depp, who supplies the often hilarious voice)."
rotten," The film is too broad to be discerning, but there are a few laughs here and there, thanks to a solid comedic ensemble."
fresh," ...(O)ver-Rashomoned with too many flashbacks, Travis produces a a slambang car chase, even though it does lead to a climax too absurd for words."
fresh," After witnessing firsthand the pleasures of Amelie Poulain's little world, I realized its oddball sense works greatly in the movie's favor."
rotten," For those eager to see those Battle School fights, Ender's time there might be the strongest point of the film."
fresh," A portrait of combustible banlieue femininity, emanating raw energy and scrappy good humor even as it builds to an unexpectedly tragic and horrifying finale."
fresh," Beautiful to look at, but deficient in the plot department."
rotten," At the very least, it's a much more satisfactory effort than that recent repeat offender Horrible Bosses 2."
rotten, The hilariously bombastic story about the ancient Battle of Thermopylae is very much like spending two hours watching someone play a video game.
rotten, The problem lies with the story these filmmakers choose to tell.
fresh," Even if the manner in which it unfolds is, in the end, fairly pedestrian, the message it strives to make definitely is not."
fresh," It succeeds as a moving story of a boy, expressively played by Aaron Johnson, whose life would have been interesting enough to justify a movie about it even if he'd never gone on to be one of The Beatles."
fresh," As an action-filled matinee flick, 'Tomb Raider' is dead on target."
fresh," Lyne's findings are often profound, even if some edge into laboured film studies territory."
fresh, Krisha stages these typical festivities with the fury of battling gods. 
rotten, Shyamalan sve lo%u0161ije reagira na gubitak statusa holivudskog bo%u017Eanstva

rotten," The movie mostly wants to look timely and seem topical. Instead, it feels irrelevant."
rotten, [An] ultimately hollow exercise in movie excess.
fresh," Debut director Clark Gregg draws strong performances from Rockwell, Huston and Brad William Henke as Victor's dim-bulb buddy."
fresh," After watching MGP I forgive Butler his Hollywood rom-coms. Who knew an American could go to the Sudan, kill lots of rebels without any consequences, and become a living legend?"

fresh, Alfonso Cuarón doesn't so much recreate his childhood in the Colonia Roma neighborhood of Mexico City as he reimagines it...
rotten," Adults will be hoping for more substance, but they won't get it as the skinny plot devotes all its time to frivolous play and increasingly tired slapstick humor."

fresh, The Creeper really expresses himself far more than his sitting duck victims.
fresh, Even if Trainwreck isn't quite as good as it should be -- it's baggy and long and loses its nerve in the third act -- it wins fans merely because it exists and for the welcome guffaws it elicits.
rotten, Rarely rises above greeting card-level would-be inspirational banality.
fresh," Characteristically, Dante's nonchalant attitude towards plot structure makes for erratic pacing (the last half hour does flag), but that's part and parcel of his breathless, anarchic style."
fresh, This is what the movies can do.
fresh, Britain's Got Talent never looked so good.
fresh, Original. Clever. Brilliant. Insert your own adjective here. Monsters Vs. Aliens is flat out the funniest flick of the year.
fresh," Provocative, unflinching and stripped of anything approaching a consoling music soundtrack, it's a must for fans of challenging, A+ intelligent cinema desperately seeking the antithesis of High School Musical."

rotten, Jeff Feuerzeig isn't skeptical enough of Laura Albert's explanations and rationalizations to reveal any more than she wants us to know.
fresh," Genial documentary is like your 50th reunion. No big drama, confrontation, revelation or insight. Men maturely make mutual decision to focus on good memories, pleasant music."
fresh, It's all rather silly and somewhat sweet.
fresh, Everything is perfect in Vertigo.
fresh, It boasts a dirty sensuality you can feel. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh, It is something of a tribute to Wallace the director that the shamelessness of Wallace the screenwriter doesn't sabotage this mission altogether.
fresh," A definite example that animated films can truly stimulate the mind, Perfect Blue is not for the faint of heart."

fresh, Joan Cusack consistently steals the movie's heat and light!
fresh, Alien will upset your mind and upset your stomach.
rotten," Whether Gaghan is striving for abusive psychological test of torture or plodding teen drama, he ends up with both."
fresh," Like every Malick film, Knight of Cups is hugely divisive and easy enough to ridicule should one be so inclined, but if you accept it on its own terms, if you get on its wavelength, it is exquisite, mysterious and resonant, worldly and wise."
fresh, I found myself concentrating more on the strange look of the film and less on the film itself.
fresh," In all of Broomfield's films, you meet people you can hardly believe exist."
fresh, Stefano Sollima also proves to be a very good director of actors... and the great work from the tremendous Benicio del Toro supports him. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten," There's not much to this movie beyond a slick procession of dark, gleaming violence."
fresh, Some may consider this a slow burn but that is part of its charm... This is the kind of gentle comedy that leaves a smile on my face. 
fresh," Park's latest feature and first English-language release is a stylish, brutal, oft-uncomfortable tale of mystery and revenge."
fresh," Part of the joke lies in seeing a megawatt star embrace his inner grouch with fantastical blunders, and part of the anticipation lies in seeing Hancock become, well, Will Smith."
fresh," Overlong...dramatically a mixed-bag, but moving. "
rotten," ""Life of Crime"" feels like a rambling car ride through the countryside with friends. The scenery is great, and the passengers are diverting, but you keep wondering where the driver is headed."
rotten, I'm beginning to get discouraged about Andrew Niccol.
fresh," A marvelous lead character, and Jude Law, a little puffier and hairier than usual, turns in a career best performance."
fresh," ""Elaine Stritch"" is filled with bluster and memories, blunt outbursts and funny moments. But more importantly, it is filled with honesty."
rotten, The movie's few good moments are crushed by Ritchie's trademark 10-ton stylistic overkill. 
rotten, The film obligingly touches on but never examines the Wikipedia page bullet points of RBG's life and work... her participation in this project feels half-hearted at best.
fresh," Released in 1962, it was pretty clearly the most intelligent spectacular within living memory. On its 40th anniversary, it's even better."
rotten," A deluge of dim jokes and rote romantic interludes between Matthew McConaughey and Jennifer Garner that are intended to recall Charle's Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol."" God help us all."
fresh," A showcase for the loose, occasionally very funny, give-and-take between instantly recognizable characters."
rotten," It's safe, competent and bland."
rotten, Won't be seen by anyone who it might shock and won't surprise anybody who's spent more than a few days around a trendy film festival sidebar.

rotten, Irrational Man is 'new' Woody Allen think Vicky Christina Barcelona with a glimmer of vintage but not enough to make it memorable.
rotten," Yes, Cage is woefully miscast, but he isn't what derails the movie."

fresh, [A] riveting prison documentary.
fresh," If they gave awards for holding a gun in every single scene of a film from start to finish, (William) Talman would have won."
fresh," I Kill Giants feels secret and dangerous, like a VHS tape dug out of a dusty crate at a yard sale; it's the kind of movie you ended up watching every week as a kid just because of how weird it made you feel. "
rotten," There's definitely a movie to be made that takes on society's obsession with appearance in a sharp, focused manner, but ""I Feel Pretty"" isn't it."
fresh, Bad Neighbours 2 highlights the prevalence and absurdity of sexism in a hilarious way.
fresh, I was thoroughly entertained.
fresh," Essentially a loving, highly stylized homage to the kind of camp apocalyptia John Carpenter used to make; the only thing missing here is an Ernest Borgnine cameo and Kurt Russell scowling in an eye patch."
fresh, 3 Faces flirts with the fish out of water comedy of these two big city folks in the country (they literally speak different languages) but its observations are too incisive and sobering to produce many laughs.
rotten, Eastwood bungles his subject.
rotten," Although it's not saying much, this is director Rob Zombie's most impressive outing behind the camera."
rotten," An insult to other bad vampire movies, which is saying a mouthful."
fresh," All the sizzling attitude of a great floor routine, and all of the discipline and heart as well."
rotten, Last Flag Flying is a forgettable effort from a filmmaker capable of far greater things.
fresh," The performances are better than the material deserves, but, even so, there's often no tangible friction between the female leads."
rotten, [I]t is a movie so desperate for your approval that it's less like a fish than a yapping puppy that keeps soiling the rug. 
fresh, An engrossing and startling documentary on Yazidi advocate Nadia Murad.
rotten, Is this movie so god-awful bad that it's hilariously good? Can't be bothered deciding. Figure that's an answer in itself.
rotten, I'd sooner sit through 32 hours of Congressional committee testimony about imported yarn than watch Shadowboxer again.
fresh," The millions of hard-working immigrants (illegal or not), and anyone sympathetic to their struggle (maybe even a Republican or two), should find this story of assimilation and trust a well-acted celebration of life in a new land."
rotten, The amount of preposterous coincidences that lead to the precarious predicament of the three muppets and their continued suffering also robs Frozen of any remote credibility.
fresh," As for Bernal and Gainsbourg, they sell their unconventional romance convincingly. And in support, French character actor Alain Chabat steals a couple of scenes as Stephane's piggish co-worker."
rotten," I, Dolours is a flawed documentary. It's short on context, long on unconvincing re-enactments; an added crime when you consider the real woman at its core."
rotten," Instead of following one story arc, it takes up several, and that proves to be the film's undoing in the long run."
fresh," A tormented movie about torment; loopy, over-reaching and occasionally suspicious. Simultaneously, it is a daring artistic endeavour."
fresh, What raises this venture a few notches above your normal acne fare is an extremely clever screenplay
rotten, L'utilisation presque exagérée de la violence rehausse la qualité du film et l'ensemble est tellement mauvais qu'il en devient bon.
fresh," Bosworth is a star in the making, but even she can't outshine the surfing footage, which is flat-out spectacular."
rotten," The very blatant set-up makes the gags feel a bit like vaudeville punchlines, coming from miles away and that much duller for their inevitability. "
rotten," Cusack brings his no-nonsense screen persona to the film but it is left to seething, angry Adrien Brody to overact his way through the role of evil emperor."
fresh, A film where the director speaks of the families that shows the country that we were and are. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten, To have four female actors of this calibre in the one place and not give them something less mediocre is a lost opportunity.
fresh," The film moves you, angers you and tears apart your preconceptions."
rotten," Sadly, contains too little of the fashion or the funk that made its predecessors so much fun."
rotten," The film never hits beats other than go-go-go, and the overall experience is unrelenting and oppressive, a cacophony of revving engines, twisted steel, and shattered glass."
rotten, Altogether this is a much softened and declawed portrait of the most divisive prime minister of recent times.
fresh," Give me the naughty over the nice, Krampus is everything I wanted this Christmas."
fresh," A bolder, brasher film, fiery in comparison with Gloria's relatively tenderness, but anchored once more by a stellar central performance. "
fresh," Women are held prisoner and other women must free them. And sometimes, it's impossible to watch."
rotten, This melodrama about men unable to express themselves emotionally except through heavy machinery isn't only clichéd: it doubles down on the clichés.
rotten, Could it be that this Adam Sandler movie is so atrocious that Sandler himself didn't want to be seen in it?
rotten," Peter Rabbit would prefer to be cool rather than charming, and ends up being utterly forgettable."
rotten, Many people leave. We stay end. Not sure why.
fresh," Although at times amorphously told and genre non-specific - Dark comedy? Soapy drama? DePalma-esque thriller? - the film holds interest as it often defies expectation and juggles its bold, complex emotions."
rotten, A lot of these shortcomings could be forgiven if Reynolds and Jackson's chemistry was sufficiently entertaining. It isn't. 
rotten," The movie just sloshes along in a heavy, slightly overdone way."
rotten, The Polar Express seems overly concerned with aping real life instead of creating its own universe.
rotten, Why did the story of this huggable species' attempted extinction leave me emotionally indifferent?
rotten, It's rare to see a movie fail in every possible area ...
rotten, This airborne Jodie Foster thriller pretty much runs on autopilot and lands somewhere between not bad and not great.
fresh," McTeer shines in her film debut, bringing to the screen a naturalness not seen in a long time."
fresh," A sassy, romantic comedy about the battle of the sexes, Someone Like You is a delight."
fresh," A documentary to make your blood boil -- if you love cars, cherish the environment, and scorn the power and privileges of oil companies. "
rotten," The skilful combination of old and new footage, almost seamlessly spliced together, still provides riveting material for viewers in a more cynical age."
fresh, balances middle-age angst with adolescent idiocy and embraces the ridiculous while playing it absolutely straight
fresh," This warm and funny film hits all the right notes, and nothing compares to the satisfaction that comes from watching Annie Mary triumphantly sing her heart out. She's as radiant as you knew she would be all along."
rotten," Between the ugly digital photography, the repellent characters, and the free-floating misogyny, Elegy is an unpleasant film."
rotten," The film does have some nice moments, but the plot is underdeveloped and overstuffed. Bedtime Stories is not nearly as funny or magical as it could haveand should havebeen."
rotten," Julianne Moore proves game for anything in this pitch-black true-crime reconstruction, where she stars as mercurial socialite Barbara Baekeland, wife of the taciturn heir to the Bakelite plastics fortune (virtuoso Stephen Dillane)."
fresh," I've seen Hunger three times, and with each screening, the spectacle of violence, suffering, and pain becomes more awful and more awe-inspiring."
fresh, A quirky meditation on the weight of the soul. Depicts a reality bathed in such absurdity that it feels like fantasy.... The film is caught between moments of great storytelling and a distended metaphor. 
rotten," The score by Marco Beltrami might suggest a mission impossible, but the movie's reality is more like a poor man's Wile E. Coyote-Road Runner cartoon..."
fresh, Miller's labor of love which he'd deliberated over for some time encompasses all the kiddie messages we've come to expect while managing to toss in the rare animation curveball: ecological themes.
rotten," Sloppily scripted and haphazardly directed, it's a cynical, satirical origin story, publicized with a red 'Make America Great Again' baseball cap."
rotten," What makes this one different? Absolutely nothing. (Sure, it's based on a true story, but I mean come on, whatever.)"
fresh, A return to the screen worthy of the title hero.
rotten," Just as inexhaustibly stupid and utterly routine as any number of John Cena, Paul Walker or Vin Diesel vehicles those young whipper-snappers eat up."
fresh, This is like a movie from the good old days of Hollywood where the good guy wins and there's an uplifting moral...beautiful color and terrific acting by Depp and Highmore. 
rotten," A violent, often lewd, R-rated action film aimed at children and childlike adults, the film is part of a new trend: making sequels because some think that having a number in your film's title is a marketing advantage."
rotten, The fact that the world ends with a pleasurable whimper in Melancholia is highly appropriate; even the final conflagration turns out to be an over-hyped non-event.
rotten," They make fun of you for watching their movies, and still they get paid!"
fresh, The result? Lots of entertaining chitchat.
fresh," Nasheed is indeed inspirational, a cool-headed but passionate and courageous guy. You end up wishing a lot more leaders were like this guy."
fresh," Paul Giamatti steals the show as Braddock's smart-*** trainer and manager, Joe Gould. Maybe it's his Oscar comeuppance."
fresh, The immediate consolation that Tehran Taboo offers is aesthetic.
rotten, [T]here's more testosterone in the Rock's goatee than in the testicles of 100 lesser men. 
fresh," If thrills and spills like the ones in Cellular have been the stuff of melodrama since Pauline was tied to the tracks, mobile phones give a filmmaker more opportunities for cross-cutting and more weird hurdles to jump."
fresh," [A] compelling, surprisingly moving documentary about an eccentric with an old-school work ethic."
rotten, Pedantic and sophistic.
fresh," A funny, complicated burst of joy, confusion and melancholy."
rotten," The structure of the film, as bouncy as Brand is himself, doesn't generate much more than curiosity. This is activism as oddity, and while that's not worthless the way some might claim, it's also not exactly inspiring."
fresh, One of the most hauntingly beautiful mysteries ever created on film.
fresh, Astro Boy should please new-generation fans as thoroughly as nostalgia-hungry adults who grew up with the cartoons of the 1960s and 1980s.
fresh, Pure popcorn pleasure for older teens and up.
rotten, This family drama remains on the surface level. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten," Though the smash-bang chases make for dumb fun, it all mostly cruises in a noisy neutral. And with his film clocking in at over two hours, director Justin Lin might have raised his own speed limit."
rotten," Maybe there is potential for more from this universe in the future, but for now, this 3-star hotel is in need of a serious renovation."
rotten," A total bomb, worse than the worst movie ever adapted from a Saturday Night Live sketch."
rotten," Fleder does Stallone no favours, directing Homefront strictly as a plodding and predictable thriller, the kind of generic project that usually stars a bunch of B-level actors."
rotten, Gimmicky recounting of the crooner's life.
rotten, In Eyes Wide Shut nothing works.
rotten, Mildly diverting celebration of loserdom.
fresh," ""A Girl Walks"" suggest a filmmaker who knows how to let her strengths compensate for her shortcomings. Think what might happen if the shortcomings get addressed."
rotten," If the deed itself is sweet, leave it to Smith to fudge the foreplay and drag the afterglow."
fresh, Invasion of the Body Snatchers validates the entire concept of remakes.
rotten," You've simply never seen such flat-out bad acting from Jeff Bridges. It almost feels like a dare: 'Let me just see how bad I can be, without anyone calling me on it.'"
fresh," Fantastic, inspiring baseball drama covers all its bases."
rotten," There's plenty of visual invention on display, but the eye can't totally silence a question from the mind: How much underwater spectacle does an Aquaman movie need before we start to drown in it?"
fresh," True to the unspoken desperation and disillusionment that toughens or chews up career-undercard boxers, tinged with post-feminist complexity and rich with classical metaphor."
fresh," Ree does what he can to fathom the mind of an inscrutable youth, but he struggles to delve too deeply into Magnus's personal life or psyche, while his distinctive approach to strategy remains a closely guarded secret."
rotten," Just as its title is perfunctorily explained but not truly related, the film lingers at too great a remove."
fresh," A stunning debut from South African filmmaker John Trengove, "
rotten," Even in period drag, this movie resembles warmed-over Forrest Gump."
fresh," It's not a film of any great pungency. In the title role, Rupert Friend is perhaps even more callow than the part requires, and the wry narration, read by Frears, is wrongly pitched. The main drawback, however, is the not terribly exciting source material"
rotten," The plot managed to anger, unintentionally amuse and then finally bore us to tears during the interminable 100 minute running time."
fresh," I have found each of the ""Iron Man"" films a marked improvement over its immediate predecessor...primarily due to the trajectory of Stark's relationship with Pepper Potts and the series' more fearsome recent villains."
fresh, The Bank Job is a solidly built and entertaining Brit B-movie about a heist that goes wrong. And right.
fresh, Some have said that Taxi Driver has lost its immediacy because the city no longer carries an overtly dour impact; but Frownland finds it again.
rotten, The intended show-stopper: a singalong of 'Double Dutch Bus' with a busload of Japanese tourists.
fresh, ...captures the spirit of the original series and makes watching these characters fun again.
fresh," Gillian Flynn's twisty novel Gone Girl was a movie waiting to happen, practically smelling of popcorn with each compulsively turned page. It's less of a whodunit than a whodunwhat, easier to spoil than egg salad at a picnic, so we'll tread lightly."
fresh," Robot & Frank is very nearly a one-man show, a master interacting with a machine. "
fresh," This offering is monster magic; it's essentially a B-movie made with an A-plus budget. It is big and broad, filled with huge action set pieces and moments of humor and surprising pathos."
rotten," Bird Box is a tidy but in the end underwhelming sci-fi thriller, perfectly average in every way aside from its delicious central concept."
fresh, Comes so damned close to perfection that many will be willing to overlook its obvious flaws. And that's great.
fresh," Neatly paving the way for [REC]3 with a cliffhanger ending, it has enough invention and wit to extend the saga into a franchise even while the novelty value of the 2007 faux documentary has worn thin."
fresh," It's Neeson Time, and it's not in the man to let us down."
fresh, There's a lot here to love.
rotten," Iron Man 2 careens between self-awareness and self-promotion, which is not to say these are opposite conditions."
rotten," What really undoes the film, though, is its formlessness."
rotten, Was the original novel ... as cheesy as this?
rotten, It's a strange thing for a movie to get more quiet when cannons fire.
fresh," Its twinkly ads take pains to exclude its more compelling thematic elements. But they're there, and worth seeking out through the fog of the other stuff."
rotten, [A] vanity project.

rotten, Drenched in nasty cynicism far beyond reason.
rotten, While there are some undeniably engaging moments - the surreal twists and savage dialogue - the film unveils a soft centre in the final third.
fresh, It's more sensational than it is artistically interesting.
fresh, It's a compelling watch as Guadagnino darkens the tone from sunny farce to something far darker as the quartet surrender sexually to their urges in a way that ensures nobody winds up a winner.
fresh, Vitally important historical documentary finally sees the light of day.
fresh," War Dogs struggles a bit with its identity, seemingly unsure whether it wants to be a comedy or a drama and thus winding up in a bit of a muddy middle. Still, the dynamic between [Miles] Teller and [Jonah] Hill goes a long way."
fresh, There isn't an ounce of fat on Cardinals... Every sequence is in service of the story and themes. Every exceptionally crafted performance is laser focused on the material.
rotten," The Last Witch Hunter is so drenched in CGI effects, it looks as if it's been dunked in a vat of lacquer."
rotten," The latest disappointing effort from Luc Besson, is probably the closest you'll come to a very bad sci-fi acid trip."
rotten," Lumpy lowbrow humor and characters as thin as a Monopoly board mar Game Night, a comedy with an irresistible premise, but that only."
fresh," An arresting film with a quartet of terrific performances, led by Fiennes. Guadagnino's English-language debut is essential viewing. Dive in."
rotten, Furry Vengeance is a collection of feeble jokes in the service of green themes. Sustainability never looked so stupid.
rotten," Relationships between people from two eras should be important in a story, but to make it a device feels like a cheat and not a very good one either."
fresh," An exhilarating hurricane of sound, vision and heady thoughts that is as powerful to experience as it is elusive when it comes to summing it all up afterwards."
rotten," Much like the television pilot it revolves around, the pale satire The TV Set doesn't quite know what it wants to be."
rotten," So defiantly humorless that it seems to punish any small amount of laughs by doubling down on every joke, reducing them to childishly annoying at best."
fresh," 30 Days of Night is a high-concept movie idea that's so good, I'm surprised we haven't seen it."
fresh, An entertaining battle of wills and styles.
rotten," It feels like the movie never really takes off, it fails to keep up and it pretty much sabotages itself. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh," The director knows how to give a certain self-parochial sense to the story that helps oxygenate the delirious, labyrinthine and insane script, capable of causing more confusion amongst viewers. [Full Review in Spanish]"
fresh," To say that there is tension between Teddy and his teacher is an understatement. It's comedic war, to be frank, with an ensemble of students who all have their own brand of powerful comedy."
rotten," Nice cinematography and set design aside, ""Robin Hood"" fails at its most basic level--it's not particularly entertaining, and as such, it's not particularly worth your time."
fresh," A bleak, bold and quietly seething look at the misogynistic culture faced by young girls in contemporary China."
fresh," Hollywood insider Shep Gordon is a raconteur and an all-around great guy, according to him and Myers, who directed a documentary about his pal."
rotten," Heroes and villains clash, then rise up to clash again, just because that's what X-Men do. The truth is, it doesn't matter Y."
fresh, A modestly fun exercise in predictability thanks to a cast that appears to relish playing cardboard cutouts.
rotten, The film constantly blows thick smoke up our a---s and calls it charity.
fresh," You might not wind up loving Pablo, exactly, but his story's a killer. Even without Pacino."
rotten, The assortment of four credited writers charged with getting Exodus whipped into shape did an alarmingly terrible job of it.

fresh," New York's ""Queen of the Night,"" the avant garde fashion icon and heroine to generations of drag queens and ""club kids,"" is captured in her element and her moment. "
rotten," The Hundred-Foot Journey is a culinary culture-clash comedy enlivened by fiery performances from Helen Mirren and Om Puri but which, like so many other Lasse Hallström films, slowly turns to gloop the longer it lasts."
fresh, I want Albert Finney's Lincoln Town Car.
rotten, This becomes a film feels like a cover version of a cover version. One that neither sends up old spy cinema nor adds much to it with its trans-Euro express of a plot.
rotten," Very predictable, but tween girls may like it."
fresh, Griffin Dunne's exemplary film has made me want to dive into Joan Didion's work; that's the highest compliment I could pay any documentary
rotten," Somehow it takes all the childhood wonder that Jurassic Park encapsulated so perfectly and forgets it, leaving behind the fossilizing bones of a behemoth that once ruled many years ago."
fresh," It is well-acted, occasionally funny, and tightly written."
fresh," Theron, Jenkins [and Ricci] get to the heart of the matter, which is that this criminal is a badly damaged human. We deeply feel that healing requires more than lip service."
rotten," It is a deeply confused picture, and as a result, it's very hard to invest in to any real extent."
fresh," Some of Ferrell's running gags fall flat, and the best laughs come when Ferrell plays straight-man to the surprisingly funny Wahlberg."
fresh," The filmmaker's gaze is clear-eyed yet compassionate, and for a self-described straight ally, strikingly queer."
rotten," Stephen King without the snap, David Lynch without the kink, teen horror without the teen hormones, Darkness Falls falls apart in a crescendo of creepy-crawly hoo-ha."
fresh, This bittersweet love story is set against the world of network news and writer-producer-director James Brooks fills his satire with some lovable heros and villains -- and characters that don't quite fit into either category.
rotten," Boring, tedious, murky and about as fun to experience as walking the plank (Parental Content Review also available)"
rotten," Much of ""Submergence"" remains frustratingly inert and vague, as though the helmer never wanted to commit to a single idea, instead offering several half-baked concepts with hopes something might stick. "
rotten," It's a sexed-up, dumbed-down Dr. T and the Women, with penguins to pacify women who've been railroaded into going to this movie by their loutish boyfriends."
rotten," A really cheesy soap opera with intermittent scenes of smutty sex. It's certainly better than the first one, albeit that's a low bar to clear."
rotten, Black or White seems manufactured to show why an alcoholic white man is always better than triflin' ass black people.
rotten, Away We Go pleads so earnestly for emotional resonance that it forgets to earn any.
rotten," The movie looks gorgeous ... but the story never really builds momentum; you keep waiting for the 'real' action to start, but it never does."
rotten," Matters of taste aside, the film's platitude-heavy dialogue and pseudo-philosophical themes are ridiculous."
rotten," Unfortunately this down-and-dirty air-quote character piece, a florid and casually misogynistic action dramedy... comes unglued early on, and then spends two hours-plus thrashing about wildly, to only middling effect."
rotten," As hard as it is to admit, Guest's once-incisive satirical bite has grown dull in its familiarity. He doesn't seem to be having as much fun here and neither are we."
rotten," This is florid science fiction, low-brow but energetic, complete with cheesy thrills."
rotten," As was the case with so many houses sold before 2008, 99 Homes presents well, but you soon start to notice the structural defects."
fresh," If giving is always a relationship, giving also entails taking, whether in business, romance or family interactions."
rotten, Love for Sale has a deep sympathy for sexual free spirits in a rigid macho society.
rotten," In essence, the real audience for this are Leon Russell aficionados, of which there are fewer today than in 1974."
rotten, Easily one of the worst films of 2016.
fresh," Relatable and realistic characters combined with a fantastically hilarious script, make the film a crowd-pleaser, and easily, one of the funniest films at Sundance this year. "
rotten, A poorly scripted film has its forked tongue sticking out of both cheeks.
fresh," [A] beautifully animated and funny, if formulaic, odd-couple comedy."
fresh," Olivier chewing up scenery as Zeus? Heck yeah, where do I sign?"
rotten," Unfortunately, as personal as she gets here, she fails to tie everything together into a cohesive thesis"
fresh, Coppola takes a subject that once would have made him gaga and explores it with tenderness and lucidity.
rotten," ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" relates the Cult of Childhood to the Negro Problem with disastrous results."
fresh," Van Sant uses Cobain's image for a portrait of physical and moral disintegration, but he also exhilarates us with his mastery of image and sound."
rotten, A remake that ought not to have been made.
fresh," Like most classic fairy tales, ""Where the Wild Things Are"" offers hints of danger and a few scary moments. ..."
rotten," Starting with a premise that a smart-aleck high school sophomore might take pride in, the film rallies late to make some points about patriarchy and female empowerment, but not before a barrage of clichés, tweeness, and inanity."
fresh," It is a production thoroughly worthy of all the talk it has created and the several motion-picture luminaries deserve to feel very proud of their performances, particularly Greta Garbo and Lionel Barrymore."
rotten," Captures the feeling of the city, and the events of Milk's life; but never captures the dynamic charisma that had to be a vital part of the man"
rotten, There are few moments in Warrior's Gate that seasoned viewers will not recognize for what they are the minute they happen.
fresh," Quaint, amusing and charming little baseball parable."
rotten," Visually as buffed as the athletes it celebrates, but also as airheaded as most of them seem to be."
fresh," While it's true that Alien: Covenant is a captivating and thrilling film and the best Alien movie in years, its biggest strength is also its greatest weakness."
rotten," Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice pits the two titans against each other with beautiful visuals, too many characters, and a borderline nonsensical plot."
rotten," An incoherent mess that fails to capitalize on its promising premise, resulting in a film that isn't exactly terrible, but almost entirely forgettable."
rotten," Ahearn works at a distinct disadvantage: Present to document the book's reception rather than its genesis, he has no direct access to the vibrant past about which his subjects reminisce, leaving him to merely coast on the iconography of Shabazz's work."
rotten," This movie is reasonably well directed by Adam Bhala Lough, but it's far too dependent on and indulgent of its subjects."
rotten, The Intervention doesn't play around with its familiar format enough to get too excited about it.
fresh," Not only does it grapple with questions of morality in a time of war, it's an intelligent, grippingly good action film as well."
rotten," O culto a este filme prova que absolutamente qualquer porcaria pode, de uma maneira ou de outra, despertar o interesse de alguém."
rotten," Star Wars fandom has been celebrated in pop culture for decades, but we're still waiting for a movie that captures it with any real level of truth."
fresh, The harmonies they strike in this reality-inspired charmer are sweetly sublime.
rotten," By frequently cutting back to the bland, drippy romance, the filmmakers undercut the intensity of the peril."
fresh," It's almost too good to be true that the Coen Brothers have adapted McCarthy's novel and brought it to the screen, though it is their bleakest work to date."
rotten," [Hall] undermines the early style and intelligence of his all-black action movie, taking audiences for the wrong kind of ride in the end."
fresh," If you're looking for a film with a heart and a soul that isn't afraid to examine the essence of what it means -- and what it might cost -- to be human, this is it."
fresh," This is The Tonya Harding Show, and Robbie portrays her with an appropriately DGAF attitude."
fresh, Great acting and a terrific plot save a storytelling flaw that has children not aging at all over a five-year period. I had trouble getting past that one. 
fresh," Give Jamie Foxx the damn Oscar already, it's done."
rotten," Herniated whimsy -- straining, as labored as those poor Brits who stuff their mouths with grits and try to talk like Southerners."
rotten, Represents a low point no Eastwood aficionado can ignore.
rotten," While the beauty of the setting is nourishing, without a narrative structure, the disjointed scenes raise questions."
fresh," The film, though, has some redeeming qualities, including the presence of Idris Elba as the obligatory good guy, who encourages Johnny to get Danny into the protective custody of a religious order."
fresh, It nestles into your consciousness with soft lighting and inspiration.
fresh, It's a fascinating documentary that debunks the myth as it tries to separate fact from fiction and in the process offers up an eye opening history lesson.
rotten," The level of disorder prevents the film from gaining any perceptible momentum, and the result is one of Wheatley's most tedious efforts."
fresh," A film full of complexity thanks to its staging, its construction of characters and the Rafael Berrio's music. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten," Kim Basinger has selected an honest attempt to demarcate actress-defining moments. Unfortunately, she has chosen...poorly."
rotten," The movie is disjointed and sometimes hard to follow, with scenes that start or end abruptly, narrative threads that go nowhere and poorly inserted flashbacks."
rotten," Playing tornado hunters Jo and Bill Harding, Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton remember their lines and wait for the props to bump into them. Neither pulls in a whole lot of interest on the screen."
rotten, What the film cries out for most is a quality supporting player. Where are Dwight Schrute and Tracy Jordan when you need them?
fresh," A bravura turn by Hoffman, plus Fosse's kinetic direction make this an unforgettable biography."
rotten, A sustained fest of self-congratulation between actor and director that leaves scant place for the viewer.
rotten," Carr's original anecdotes don't supply much storyline, so Hicks spans the gaps with golden-lit montages set to Sigur Rós. They're a great advertisement for Australian vacations. And vasectomies."
rotten," Mr. Gyllenhaal's strong performance still doesn't add enough substance to a film that is hollow at the center. It's mostly the fault of Mr. Sipe, who seems to believe that saying nothing is saying something."
fresh," Boasts a subtle, nuanced turn by Christian Bale."
fresh," Not dissimilar in merrily ghoulish spirit to 'The Nightmare Before Christmas', it's hugely entertaining."
fresh," While Farhadi is a master of the drama, his gifts are at times an awkward fit for a kidnapping thriller. It is almost as if one bought a ticket for a Liam Neeson movie and wound up instead in a Strindberg play."
rotten," Plays like an outtake reel interspersed with scenes of real dramatic weight, making for one of the most uneven cinematic rides in recent memory."
rotten," The Fog is a bore, laden with unspectacular special effects and dreadful acting from television-trained youth who don't have the experience to truly deliver the goods."
fresh," Reasonably thoughtful, moderately engaging material dealing with some thorny issues. It may be a catalyst for intelligent conversation, which is more than you can say for most movies."
fresh," Thanks in part to Academy Award winning director Ang Lee and producer Gale Anne Hurd, this interpretation of the Hulk has incredible style and detail."
fresh, The intricate plotting sometimes stretches credibility but exemplary performances from the entire cast and superlative camera work by Martin Gschlacht keep the ship afloat.
fresh," The Return of the King runs for 200 minutes, and I estimate that I cried for 195 of them, give or take two, including through most of the end credits."
rotten," Recycled plot, lame sight gags, Leprechaun-like stock Irish characters. The charms of Amy Adams rescue 'Leap Year' from Truly Awful status."
rotten," Ten astronauts try to tell it like it was, but weighted down by the heaviness of the politics that created the lunar exploration program, the best stories will have to wait for later"
fresh," It's not a life changing comedy, but it works as general entertainment. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten," This is by no means a boring film, then, but it is a grotesque one, and that brings it pretty close to camp."
fresh," The Way Back works well enough as a sprawling adventure of unimaginable hardship. The rugged vistas (it was filmed in Bulgaria, India and Morocco) are impressive. But it feels just a bit underpopulated."
fresh, One man's dark night of the soul brought on by civil war in Chad.
fresh, ... I heartily recommend rounding up friends and family (bring those older kids) for the feel-good high school documentary Step.
rotten," Michael Bay dialling it back still leaves plenty of room for bombast, bombs and baloney."
rotten," A dreadful and creepily exploitative would-be thriller, low-grade trash that it is too silly and stupid to be as offensive as it frequently comes close to being throughout."
rotten, A faith-based film that won't inspire converts.
rotten, An unappealing and operatic screen adaptation of the Brothers Grimm fable.
rotten, It feels like they are making it up as they go along. 
rotten," For those looking for a sports film of basic quality and genuine narrative, ""My All American"" is definitively useless."
rotten," Director Jeff Kopas has talent and a decent eye for imbuing scenes with subtle menace but, as co-writer of the screenplay, he also shares some responsibility for a story that doesn't quite hang together."
rotten," Pete Doherty tries his absolute best, and in some ways isn't every bit as terrible as you might think."
fresh," Locked out, by choice or chance, Vincent strikes a profound chord in this startling, evocative film."
fresh," For better and worse, the pieces comprising Must Love Dogs are borrowed from every other romantic comedy."
fresh," For almost all ages, this is a heart-warming, imagination-tickling joy - and a film that should put Ishida and Colorido on every anime fan's to-watch list."
rotten, Yet the crushing disappointment of the film (which matches archive footage with contemporary reflections) is that nothing really happens. 
rotten," The rationale behind this unattractive animated comedy, a U.S.-German coproduction, seems to be that since it can't create a fairy-tale world of its own, it might as well riffle through many of the more familiar ones."
rotten," As a production project it was, apparently, stuck in ""development hell"" for more than a decade. Sometimes projects are stuck in development hell for a reason."
rotten," At times incoherent, at times self conscious and thanks to Dante Spinotti being allowed to go hand held, almost always irritating to watch."
rotten," Making Traitor something more than a disposable B-movie was possible, but at this point in the release calendar, way more effort than it was worth."
fresh," Coogler and company get the essence of ""Rocky,"" from the Italian Stallion's rambling, close-mouthed monologues to the woodwind and horn-based score to the cornball montages."
rotten," I wish the rest of the movie felt as fully realized as [McAdams'] performance because, like the relationship at its center, there's potential here for something beautiful that feels just out of reach."
rotten," Pretty goofy idea, but kids will probably be diverted by it."
rotten, This Dublin-set horror rehashes every haunted-house trick in the book.
rotten," Although Franco's clearly enjoying himself, and Statham smashes faces with finesse, two warring films emerge, neither of them particularly convincing."
fresh," Long, loud, ludicrous, mindlessly enjoyable..."
fresh, We learn just as much about ourselves watching it as we do about those enduring the details firsthand.
rotten," Inferno needs to move like a shot, but it crawls like an exhausted toddler."
rotten, The Majestic insults the likes of Dalton Trumbo
rotten," Even with Mara and Segel in the lead, The Discovery is unable to make a somewhat interesting story; that initial compelling idea is wasted in this dull and stale sci-fi film."
fresh," A miscarriage of justice on this scale would have been tragic had it resulted from an honest mistake - but, as this meticulously researched movie makes clear, honesty had little to do with it. "
rotten, The complete lack of interesting characters and almost no narrative at all makes for a film that's hollow. The storm has more personality than the people who flee from it.
fresh, The connection between the still-potent issues of the civil rights movement and the rich vs. poor economic disparities that continue today -- although 'The Man' could now be either black or white -- gives Barbershop genuine potency.
fresh, This superbly crafted and impeccably acted civil rights drama is the first major Oscar contender of the year.
fresh, This film about Nick Cave utterly rejects the established tropes of the rock doc.
fresh," Baffling from beginning to end, but also woozily beautiful."
rotten," No comic relief, no bursts of spontaneity -- everything seems calculated and overthought, muddling the message."
rotten, It's all too much to explore with any depth.
rotten, That those blemishes begin to disappear each time her kids learn from her teachings offers a somewhat disturbing statement on the value of physical beauty.
fresh, A tad too obvious for my liking but then it's a Sean William Scott movie -- so obviously it's obvious. But as a tennis redemption movie (not too many of them around) it stands out for a sense of gruff fun.
rotten," A isappointing hybrid that's too bloated, diffuse and tedious to work as a regular length movie -- yet has not enough emotional range or narrative focus to be considered a great epic drama."
rotten, Trevorrow never quite finds the moments that made the first film so transcendent.
fresh," Romantic melodrama. If contemporary viewers think of ""Notorious"" in those terms, it will still strike them as the classic it's become."
rotten," This time the origin story is under the sea in a fight for dynasty, but Aquaman is unable to disembark from the kitsch weight that is characteristically DC. [Full Review in Spanish]"
fresh," Memory, love, loneliness, new family models ... great themes of this exciting movie. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten," ...A case study in both the perils of delayed gratification, and of prizing ominous aesthetics above genuine scares. Let's hope its own progeny don't follow in its footsteps."
fresh, A darkly affecting tale about the high and sometimes bloody cost of self awareness and sociopathic conviction.
fresh," Anderson's trademark tongue-in-cheek humour and deadpan quips are there to ease the way, which seem more fluidly delivered by puppets than in Anderson's live-action fare."
fresh, [Charm City] helps the viewer imagine a future that doesn't require a massive armed police presence to make neighborhoods like Rose Street safer.
fresh," Nolan again transforms Bob Kane's classic DC Comics creation into a superhero for our times, flawed but fighting against supervillains and also the decay and corruption that created them."
rotten," Essentially an autobiographical coming-of-age movie, one that includes a good many affecting moments but, in the last analysis, doesn't manage to bring them together into a satisfying whole."
fresh," An accomplished coming-of-age psychodrama-cum-thriller with echoes of Carrie, Thelma unsettles and frightens. "
fresh," Ascher makes a persuasive case that it is the physiological phenomenon of sleep paralysis that has created the nightmare tropes now commonplace in art and literature: they are recognisable, diagnosable symptoms."
rotten, Blunt's impressive performance [is] the single saving grace that keeps it from going off the rails completely.
rotten, There are no bad dogs. But there are bad dog movies.
fresh, Est immédiatement devenu mon film de Pixar favori.
rotten, [T]here's little in the French film to distinguish it from more superfluous genre flicks...
fresh, ...a delicate romantic fantasy that requires that you willingly suspend your disbelief and give yourself over to it. Cynics need not apply. 
fresh, Other films this year will have to sweat bullets to match the explosive power and subversive wit of David Cronenberg's A History of Violence.
rotten, For me Ctrl is a case of too much talking (about stuff I'm not versed enough in to fully grasp) and not enough forward momentum. A low-fi intellectual take on the sentient machine.
fresh," 3rd Street Blackout has a genuine and relatable feel to it. If you like a feel-good love story based in the modern age, you'll enjoy this film."
fresh, effectively merges important political issues with mass-market entertainment without canceling each other out
fresh," In lesser hands, this material would make for a banal after-school special; but writer and director Jim McKay (Girls Town) is clearly comfortable not only with his characters but also the lower-class urban milieu they inhabit."
fresh," It's proof positive that no matter the genre or the language or the actors she uses, [Denis is] one of the most capable masters of the craft that we have working today."
rotten," Overall, The Dark Tapes is a colossal waste of time."
rotten," To the Wonder is visually deep and beautiful, but the characters and story are complete non-factors for the film."
fresh," It's the rare movie that truly evokes the grindhouse '70s, because it means everything it's doing. It's exploitation made with vicious sincerity."
rotten," Director Robert De Niro's no frills approach to spying is probably a more realistic one, but not always as interesting."
fresh," Pic has a grisly sense of humor, and sometimes is so gross and over the top the film tips over into a bizarre comedy."
fresh, It's a film worth queuing for - and you haven't been able to say that about anything with Clint's name on it in quite a while.
fresh," If I can find any quibble with this richly rewarding film, it's that it's about Queen Victoria and Prince Albert -- a subject that in itself isn't that inherently exciting."
fresh, A Fantastic Woman ultimately succeeds on the strength of [Daniela] Vega's sympathetic performance.
fresh," The film offers several layers of reading, but, as in the case of good films, the interpretation that you want to give them or how you want to discover them depends on the spectator. [Full Review in Spanish]"
fresh," Had it dug a bit deeper, it might have been something more than the overall pleasant entertainment vehicle that it is."
fresh," Nettelbeck throws together a child who isn't cute and a woman who isn't lovable, and the result is one of the year's more heartwarming movies."
rotten, Emotional and comedic inconsistency plagues the movie's flow.
fresh," The languid, observational style of director Julia Loktev will frustrate those expecting stuff to, like, happen more, but it has its real rewards."
rotten," American Reunion tries to use nudity, sex, and fecal matter to generate laughter, but the jokes are tired and predictable."
fresh, What's wisest and most significant is that the film becomes more than the story of survival. 
fresh," Settles for a more modest level than Aardman's previous efforts. Strong on visual invention and wacky humor but light on story and characterization, it's about on the level of a Blue Sky feature, in particular recalling Robots."
fresh," Especially when viewed through an agreeable lens of adolescent wonderment, it gets a lot more right than its predecessor."
rotten," The dialogue is written in a sort of rigid formality that completely defeats the actors, although it's hard to tell if the performances are deliberately stilted or just bad."
fresh," That's one small step for Apollo 11 hoaxers, one giant leap for Matt Johnson."
fresh, Serves as a really good and entertaining book end for the end of the series...
rotten," Where the first Ice Age was low-key, this one is more frantic. And this time around the material is cruder, more lowbrow than it needs to be."
fresh, French-born writer-director Sophie Barthes has done a wonderful job fleshing out the novel's themes inside of two hours.
rotten, Inspiring true story wipes out on underdog clichés and waves of melodramatic Hollywood cheese. 
rotten," Forgive the straw-grasping, but a film made with such care inspires a search for meaning."
fresh," Audrey Tautou is nice in the main role, if you like a face as pretty as a pain au raisin with an expression playing limited but appealing variants on waif-like ingratiation."
rotten, It's yet another comedy that's trying too hard to sell something past its date.
fresh," [A] clear-headed and touching film about finding your own purpose, accepting others as they are and, most importantly, forgiveness."
fresh," Lawrence, so good in Winter's Bone, comes as a revelation."
fresh," In its substance, the film is an effective call for individuals to reduce sugar intake while exposing the places those sugars may reside."
fresh," A raucous, entertaining, and incredibly funny film that respects the premise of the original series..."
fresh," ...an epic romp across the breadth if the Marvel Cinematic Universe with all the action, comedy, pageantry, and sturm und drangyou could hope for."
rotten," Ryan Gosling has taken many great visual skills from his time with director Nicholas Winding Refn, but unfortunately his writing still has a long way to go, turning Lost River into an aimless and bland experience to rival Refn's own Only God Forgives."
rotten," Warcraft: The Beginning is less a complex immersive digital experience than a simplified sub-Lord of the Rings tale, pitching humans against a race of Orcs."
fresh," Writer/director Mike Binder scripts sarcastic humor and dialogue that just avoids being glib, thanks in part to a pair of rich performances."
fresh," The film's best moments belong to Teresa Palmer as unexpected backup to Number Four, who makes a fiery entrance every bit as dramatic as Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator."
rotten," Hey, it could be worse. It could be Spielberg's Hook."
rotten, A willful mess made interesting by the talent that it attracted.
rotten," Though Mr. Woodcock (tee-hee!) starts with that strong enough premise, it never bulks up the plot with comedic muscle and weighs in as a 98-pound weakling."
fresh, As a late-summer treat for adults with a childlike sense of wonder -- or older children with a grown-up sense of adventure -- 9 is a definite 8 out of 10.
fresh," A marvellous movie, shot in stunning black-and-white by Freddie Francis."
rotten, Snatched is narratively incoherent and often really boring. It's more like an extended sketch show where only every second or third joke works.
rotten, A fragmentary and amateurish fairy tale.
fresh," The Hate U Give isn't a perfect piece of cinematic activism or even a narratively balanced bit of storytelling, but it's still perfect in all the ways that matter most."
rotten," The film is beautifully shot in chilly blues and grays by cinematographer Roger Deakins, and Los Angeles locales are well chosen for futuristic effect. Most of the time, however, I found myself glancing at the clock on my own wrist."
fresh, A Date For Mad Mary feels like an Ireland-set cross between Bridesmaids and Muriel's Wedding.
rotten," In Beautiful Boy, the themes are vast but the picture is small, and the ensuing emptiness is what the characters are meant to feel -- not us."
fresh," The movie truly belongs to Mortensen; fierce and tender and tremendously flawed, he's fantastic."
rotten, A convoluted tearjerker complete with murky camerawork and even murkier emotions.
rotten," A curiously empty exercise in blockbuster filmmaking, Man Of Steel is full of sound and fury signifying... you know what."
fresh," If this does turn out to be the 65-year-old director's last foray into this territory, it's a great note to go out on."
fresh," [As] a more contemplative look at the ways unexplained tragedy plays with the emotions of people who supposedly have it all, it works."
rotten, The movie doesn't feel authentic and I think it's because of all the white folks involved.
rotten," Wilde has one of those faces cameras love, thus her other career as a model. There are suggestions in ""Endless"" that she might have acting talent too. But the director rarely asks."
fresh," Thankfully the movie is able to overcome this familiarity by being monstrously entertaining, Howard giving the picture a stirring central figure galvanizing a person's attention and energizing their interest."
fresh," Oldman dominates the film, capturing Churchill's outsized, blustery personality, along with a mischievous sense of humor ..."
fresh, A strong performance by Elijah Wood and impressive technical directing by Nacho Vigalonda keep the tension high even as leaps in logic become increasingly prevalent.
fresh," One of the most compelling movies of the year because of its eyebrow-raising true-life story, one performed so well by the likes of Washington, Driver, and, in a masterpiece of tone control, Topher Grace."
fresh, It's a reboot and a sequel that pays respect to its roots while also paving its own path in to the annals of science fiction and action cinema...
rotten," Everybody deserves better than The Secret Life of Bees. That includes the filmmakers, the cast, the crew, the audience ... you name it."
fresh," Notable primarily as a platform for a thespian tour de force by Plummer and Mirren, and they're not to be missed."
rotten, A somewhat muddled yarn that's more tease than delivery.
rotten," Though it looks like a Wes Anderson film, it doesn't feel like one."
fresh, Some fascinating music history and watching Angelo's amazing antics add up to a very engaging audience experience. 
fresh," You'll dig this movie a ton, because it's basically a master filmmaker taking a stroll down memory lane and exploring what makes his work stand out."
fresh," The miracle of A Separation is that it doesn't spare any of its characters, nor does it seek to indict them. It is a democratic portrait of a theocratic world."
rotten," ...just as sloppily caffeinated as before, with an extra layer of scummy race jokes."
fresh," It's not first rate horror, but it gets the job done."
fresh," Worth seeing, but a near-miss."
fresh," For anyone with even a passing interest in cinema, Hitchcock is a legendary figure and a story that purports to take us inside his private world and public life is irresistible"
fresh," The doc also recalls a simpler age when people became famous because of their accomplishments, rather than striving for fame as a goal in itself."
fresh, The critic in me wants to boo and hiss and cry in disappointment. The 5-year-old in me wants to stand up and applaud.
rotten," There's an interesting idea at its core that it never commits to, and Saltiel can't fully execute what he does try to explore."
rotten," Though dazzled by its ultra-modern wizardry and the high gloss of its production values, one can also feel the globalist double standard roiling underneath the adolescent-kid fantasy plot."
rotten," Trumped is among the first filmic takes on the election, but it surely won't be the last. And being so quick off the starting block may actually be a liability."
rotten," While Charlie Bartlett's spitting in the face of authority may thrill disenchanted teens, its obnoxiousness and phoniness is enough to make me feel like an old man yelling at kids to get off my lawn."
rotten," Three excellent performances and undeniably gripping - and important - subject matter just manage to support a dunderheaded script, ham-fisted direction and a lead performance from Rachel Weiss that borders on the unwatchable."
rotten, The film struggles to stretch out the familiar Schulz cartoons into a substantial feature film.
fresh, The most interesting sequence is Polina's descent into Antwerp's nightlife.
rotten," It creates a seasonal glow, but inconsistencies keep Fred Claus off the 'Nice' list this Christmas."
fresh," An important film, serious, well crafted and relevant. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten, ...the movie has all the depth of a video game. These aren't people. They're not even interesting characters. They're game pieces.
rotten," Disappointing, frustrating nonsense."
rotten," Mr. Ritchie is one of the worst bogus ""directors"" in film history. I just hoped he might have grown up enough to enlighten the world about the secret lives of two of my favorite mystery characters. Alas, they're both as cardboard as a Madonna lobby"
fresh," Still, Hill's choices are mostly smart, and the film works well when throwing the three men - Brolin, McBride, and Jordan - together into set pieces recycled from better comedies. "
fresh, Elton knows how to locate the laughs in his material - and he's a shameless crowdpleaser - but his emotional reach only goes skin deep.
fresh, [The Backward Class] raises the important question of how far people are willing to go to truly empower the disadvantaged on a substantial level.
rotten," A mystery without surprises, a thriller without thrills. It's too bad, really, because the movie has a few strong points."
rotten," Expect to be reminded of other, better films, especially Seven, which director William Malone slavishly copies."
rotten, Suffers by comparison with Hero's entrancing superreality.
fresh," It's an atmospheric, thought-provoking, melodramatic debut from July Jung."
fresh, An interesting comment on parent-child relationships ... there's a certain amount of mystery ... and disappointment to [one's] parents.
rotten," Speaking of love, things go blooey instead of gooey whenever heroine and hero come close enough to touch; far from being sensual, let alone erotic, the movie proves to be not much fun at all."
rotten, It turns out What's Your Number? isn't any smarter or savvier about sex and its collateral damage than the idiotic fake women's-magazine study that provides its premise.
rotten, A rather good original idea has dwindled into self-parody.
fresh," A childlike wonder wedded to dazzlingly imaginative visuals, in a story of surprising simplicity and equally surprising emotional depth."
rotten," Thrilling, ridiculous (the script, by Emmerich and longtime co-writer Harald Kloser, is riddled with howlingly goofy lines and seriously improbable deus-ex-machina moments), and just plain big, dumb fun."
rotten," ...it's hard to get past the idea of Taking Woodstock as a missed opportunity. It's fine around the edges, but it never convinces you that the central event was the cataclysmic cultural convergence some claim."
rotten," The movie lopes along from one half-baked scene to the next, interrupted on occasion by car-porn sequences involving the hero's luminous limo the Black Beauty."
fresh," Kloves' adaptation is so faithful, in fact, that even the Alfred Stieglitz portrait of Georgia O'Keeffe hanging over student Hannah Green's bed -- a throwaway descriptive detail in Chabon's novel -- turns up in the movie."
rotten," No movie this year, maybe EVER in your entire life, has tried this hard to tug at your emotions and make you cry, cheer and laugh. Too bad Marley & Me is too long and has trouble with nuance"
rotten," While there's some good action while the brothers are holding up the banks, this film is mostly conversation between Pine and Foster, on the one hand, and Bridges and Birmingham, on the other. Compelling is not the word for which I would be groping."
fresh," Singer's stark black-and-white photography renders their world with the abstract horror of a German expressionist film, yet he's equally skilled at coaxing the grim personal stories of life underground."
fresh," With its genius cast, wonderfully calibrated emotional and comic beats, and brilliant 70s mimesis, Battle of the Sexes is slick, commercial filmmaking at its best."
fresh," A watchable, well acted teen drama with some original, offbeat ideas."
rotten," as cheap and cheesy as its brethren, but oddly boring for long stretches"
fresh," An arresting political expose punctuated by stellar acting and resonant messages about leadership, sacrifice and responsibility."
fresh," Ultimately, if the Swedish version is near perfection, Matt Reeves's version achieves complete supremacy. Masterpiece is an overused word, but it's hard to think of another so powerful. Let Me In is the new standard for vampire movies."
fresh," David Slade infuses this third entry with the kind of visceral set-pieces, knowing humour and more measured melodrama that the saga has been sorely lacking."
fresh," It should not be overlooked that in a story in which the protagonists are men, the eyes of a woman [director Valeska Grisebach] dissects them perfectly. [Full review in Spanish]"

fresh," The performances of Plummer and Nichols have a sweet, open quality and this is an engaging coming-of-age story."
rotten," A hyperbolic melodrama which oversimplifies its issues, and features too many scenes of Binoche weeping against picturesque Irish landscapes."
fresh, Executed with graciousness and sweetness.
rotten," ""The Congress"" becomes as frustrating and expensive-looking as ""Cloud Atlas."" Try to follow it and you may feel abandoned in a maze."
fresh," In the wake of the Trayvon Martin verdict, this compassionate film reclaims the humanity of victims transformed into political symbols and provides context for those who think the media and not Zimmerman's bullet 'injected race' into the Martin killing."
fresh," If it weren't for the god-awful music and a few tonal missteps, this would be a near-perfect meditation on love, loss and the evolution of the American child."
rotten, The not-so subliminal message about life being fair versus breaking the law isn't enough to carry a film purporting to be a character-driven drama.

fresh," The strength of Away From Her rests on the laurels of an excellent director and Julie Christie whose demanding role is interpreted with subtlety, humor and wisdom. Polley said she only had Christie in mind when the film was to be cast."
rotten," The last ten minutes of The Cobbler are a special kind of awful. The rest is a mere disappointment coming from McCarthy, but business as usual for Sandler."
fresh," While the plot might be the flimsiest, the characterisation actors Morgan Freeman and Diane Keaton bring to this film turns it into a small delight."

fresh," Fairly well-made...[but] I'm not convinced that watching people get tortured and killed is worthwhile as entertainment, regardless of whether or not they deserve it."

rotten," Every pointless moment is visually dull, too, shot like a bland TV update of Some Kind of Wonderful."
rotten," Once a darkly comic romp centered around outing a pedophile teacher, this adaptation has been shorn of its sharpest edges, leaving a largely unfocused, conventional teen dramedy in its place."
rotten, the uncomfortable interplay between saccharine and silliness never settles into a cohesiveness that would make the story work. 
fresh," These scenes bring an unbearably jagged experience, moored by [Kristen] Stewart's strong central performance"
rotten," Co-writers Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck (who also directed) expand their indie-circuit short to feature length, and a padded-out short is just what it looks and feels like."

rotten, It's certainly more entertaining and competent than most of the previous DCEU films but that makes its silly missteps and bloated plot all the more frustrating.

fresh," The volatile chemistry between Ms. McCarthy and Ms. Bullock is something to behold, and carries ""The Heat"" through its lazy conception and slapdash execution."
rotten," The latest Hollywood movie to give comic books a bad name, Elektra stars Jennifer Garner as a superheroine who dons fetish-wear the color of blood before laying waste to every man in sight."
rotten," Raises more questions than it answers as it attempts to convince us that a moralistic sniper would torture a sleazy publicist into tears of guilt and remorse over what amounts to a few paltry, venial sins."
rotten, Never gets beyond stereotypes.
rotten," Ingmar Bergman's best film, I suppose, though it's still fairly tedious and overloaded with avant-garde cliches."

fresh," 'Small Time' still closes the deal, thanks to that one indefinable selling point: star charisma."
rotten," Eat them already, I'm bored."
fresh," Gnomeo & Juliet is Romeo & Juliet...but with gnomes? That's TERRIBLE. It's like doing Moth-ello, a kids' film about a Moorish general who hatches from a cocoon, flies towards lightbulbs and eats jerseys. "
fresh," In addition to being terribly funny, Mr. Roosevelt feels totally now."
rotten," Such a snooze, barely putting in the effort to be a proper nail-biter before it reveals that it was never about suspense anyway. It somehow bores and disappoints in the same instant. "
rotten, A bunch of generic types get into a massive shootout in 211...
rotten," Now is not the time to bring out a film that is positive about vigilantism and vengeance down the barrel of a gun. Beside all that, it just is not a very good film."
rotten," You can probably guess what must happen during the course of this road trip. Even less surprising than its story arc, however, are its character details."
fresh, It's got all the heart and soul that's been missing from every other superhero movie that isn't about the X-Men.
fresh," This film will not be easily forgotten or shaken off, I guarantee this is one for the ages%u2026 you are about to enter a new frontier of horror."
fresh," Guess what? You can fight City Hall. Matt Tyrnauer's excellent documentary, Citizen Jane: Battle for the City, shows how it's done, a call to arms that could not be more timely in this chaotic political moment."
fresh," Fans of Lynch will find much to savor here: the ripe detail, the arch humor, the hallucinatory enigmas, the eroticism, the terror."
fresh," ""One Day"" is a beautiful movie, but beautiful in a way that life often is, not movies."
fresh," Performed with unflinching honesty, it's a story that'll be familiar to countless teens, and the film could well have a long life as required, vivid viewing for high-schoolers, who'll have plenty to discuss after its poignant ending."
rotten," I have never seen a movie work harder or more hopelessly...not merely to launch a new franchise, but to jump from a standing start into a full-blown Marvel-style shared cinematic universe in one go."
fresh," There's so much fresh air in this stunningly good biography that it feels like you've never encountered a rags-to-riches, tortured-artist story before. Not just for fashion lovers."
fresh," Screenwriters David Chirchirillo and Trent Haaga pose a simple question -- how much will a person degrade himself to make ends meet? -- but it's a potent one, at least for those of us who ponder it every Monday through Friday."
fresh," This Swedish thriller isn't just a great crime film, it's a great film, period. Based on the novel by Jens Lapidus, Easy Money is positively Dickensian in its themes and scope."
fresh," Wiener-Dog is no triumph, but if you like Todd Solondz-or dogs-you'll probably enjoy it. "
fresh," The Afghan boys' kite-flying contests are the emotional core of the film, and Forster and his crew bring the camera into the sky and make it dip and soar along with the kites."
rotten," A muted, almost Rohmer-like moral tale that doesn't quite dive deeply enough into its several characters."
fresh," Smartly directed, brilliantly written and featuring a pair of terrific comic performances from its two leads, this is a thoroughly enjoyable comedy-horror that's laugh-out-loud funny from start to finish."
fresh," The extraordinary expressive performers, male and female; the haunting interior and exterior conflicts; the painstaking authenticity of the period detail; and the subtly modulated mood shifts all combine to make a modern masterpiece of an old legend."
fresh," As with Paris, Je T'Aime, New York, I Love You works as both romance film and seductive travelogue, but some will find its 'arty' posturing more maddening than magical."
fresh," Against the competition for all the coveted year end awards in the animation category, ""Anomalisa"" stands out."
rotten," Attempting to instill wit into a witless horror flick, Diablo Cody shows that her faux-hip dialogue does not a feature make."
rotten," There's plenty of mumble, but it's missing its core."
rotten, Fascinating but shaky experiment.
fresh," Smart and scary like its predecessor, it delivers the shocks and a fair amount of sly wit."
fresh," For all the ill-fitting elements and plot holes, 'Warm Bodies' pulls everything together with a cheery spirit and a sense of - dare I say it? - heart. "
rotten, Overlong and overly obvious
fresh, It may not be the perfect sequel but it is an epic one.
fresh, A trio of kids enjoy a rollicking adventure
rotten," ""Taken 2"" is so much lousier than need be, and its action sequences look as if they were put together by someone who doesn't know what he's doing."
fresh," Hunt plays the Eve Arden role of Tomei's wisecracking pal to perfection, making her the single best reason to see the movie."
fresh, A disturbing and extraordinary work.
rotten," Miles Teller certainly has a way with a wisecrack. But otherwise, file next to Broken Lizard's execrable Beerfest."
fresh," Everything I said about the last two movies, plus some new additions from the AARP action heroes club, plus a couple of Expendable interns to bring down the median age a bit."
fresh," The Happy Prince is an unapologetic character study, one that breaks through Wilde's façade to reveal a man in turmoil, aware of his flaws, but unable to help himself."
fresh," Four years after astounding audiences with his starkly grim mob tale ""Gomorrah,"" Matteo Garrone returns with a more garish, and superficial, vision of Italian culture."
fresh, A sharply witty and touching saga of Israeli lonely hearts. 
rotten, Two distinctly different approaches to filmmaking are employed here and neither of them manages to eke out a victory over the other.
rotten," Araki, who must be applauded at least for brazenly championing bisexuality, really should have saved the title of his 1994 effort for this one: Totally F***ed Up."
fresh," Gives us a vivid feel for the bedhopping, acid-dropping subculture, if a little less insight than you'd hope..."
fresh," Difret is a true story, that dives into the layer of polite social customs to expose a deeply set patriarchal system, which promotes hostile conditions for women in Ethiopia."
rotten," Unfortunately, documented fact doesn't lend itself particularly well to exhilarating cinema."
rotten," Mirren and Sutherland are a very strong duo, and they carry The Leisure Seeker through its endless strange shifts in tone..."
fresh," ...a compassionate film and an honest one, proving that all involved are still at the top of their games."
rotten," An uneven, mildly amusing, and highly derivative flick featuring a wonderful, quirky cast as a crew of art thieves who run a complex scam on the art world, and on each other."
rotten," Sincere, whimsical and pretty dreary."
fresh, It helps to have a cast stocked with ringers with the chops to play comedy as drama and drama as comedy.
fresh," A jaunty and forthright production with a lively look reflecting the book's illustrated pages [that] does a great job of being in two places at once: In the head and gangly bodies of kids, and in the hearts of those of us who have survived grades 6-8."
rotten, The film has the eerie atmosphere and outstanding makeup effects of a good fantasy thriller. But it's way too choppy to build any tension.
rotten," It's literally just quiet drama between a shy girl and her more outgoing friend accompanied by classical music. I'm sure there's an audience for Liz and the Blue Bird, but I'm just not a part of it."
rotten," Even under his own established guidelines, Gillespie pushes his fantasy past the point of possibility."
rotten," will no doubt divide viewers into those who agree that it is high time that the original received so slick a makeover, and those who wonder whether there is much real point to a retooling of such devilish fidelity to its source."
fresh," Whenever Sin Nombre turns violent, it seizes you with its convulsive skill, but the film's images   vastly outstrip its imagination."
rotten," The results come close to those cheesy re-enactments we see during ""true crime"" documentaries on Oxygen and other cable channels."
rotten, There are undoubtedly worse video game adaptations... [but] Assassin's Creed is plenty bad in its own right and hardly deserves pity points.
fresh, This inventive adaptation of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's children's book is beautifully realized in CG and stop-motion animation techniques.
rotten," It panders to overstressed, underappreciated mothers-and there are plenty of them-by offering them a phony fable of empowerment, one that's no more than a raucous, sitcom-level farce."
rotten, This well-meaning mistake gets lost in the metaphors.
rotten," Liam Neeson's most arthritic action movie yet isn't one with a number wedged in its title. It's difficult to not think about the fun and finesse ""John Wick"" brought to a similar scenario, and how joylessly obligatory all of this feels by comparison."
rotten, Marshall directs as if Marty had never happened.
rotten," Your time is better spent tracking down a DVD of the original, which was a highlight of a rapidly deteriorating genre."
rotten," [T]he ambition of the movie makes it sort of intriguing, too, even if it fails -- spectacularly -- in the end..."
rotten," ...a disposable horror film, made in hopes that some reputable actors might breathe life into the material."
fresh," A complex film, full of moral thorns that questions the conventional idea of family, filmed with a serene camera that lets the agitation rather be produced by the internal exaltation of the characters, and by the montage. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten," [A] dour animated adventure that aspires to holiday joy, but is as enjoyable as a sock full of coal."
rotten," Oh, what could have been. While Disney seems to understand that girl power can mean big box office (see Frozen), they still seem unable to fashion female characters that boast true complexity, agency and independence."
rotten," If ""Bridget Jones's Baby"" is the best an actress like Zellweger can expect from the film industry, maybe she'd be better off just saying ""Hashtag: Let's not."""
rotten," Rather than be a Vonnegut story, as the original is, the newest Rollerball is what writers like Vonnegut warn us about."
rotten, Gives the impression of an in-joke that never quite lands.
rotten, What might have seemed like a lively idea -- an all-star roundelay about love in Los Angeles -- is as fossilized as the wooly mammoths in the La Brea Tar Pits.
rotten," If Eye of the Beholder ever had something to say, that got lost in not knowing how to say it."
fresh, Audiences looking for grand escapist fare at cinemas this summer won't mind having spent their price of admission on it. Be sure to get some popcorn too.
fresh," The script, by husband-and-wife novelists Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida, has real heart, though, without being cloying."
fresh," Efron and Poots don't quite work together, but Mackenzie Davis is very good as the privileged, but secretly passionate, Chelsea."
fresh," [A] tongue-in-cheek, knife-in-guts action thriller..."
fresh, This fun buddy movie is something like a semi-slapstick Midnight Run starring Abbot and Costello.
rotten," ""The Last Station"" is the kind of dramatically bound historic material that could soar on Broadway with the cast, but not the script, of its film version."
rotten, A poor remake with little 3D value.
fresh," Directors Ben Cotner and Ryan White are dedicated to getting it all in, which occasionally impedes the flow of the story."
fresh," Director Chan doesn't skimp on the hand-to-hand, foot-to-face, and occasional sword-to-shoulder action."
rotten," We're left with a sweeping teenage romance, which is fine thanks to the film's two young leads, but wastes a pretty spectacular setup."
fresh, It's a high-concept premise that's employed to consistently engaging effect by filmmaker Michael Sucsy...
rotten, Under the gloss it's like the failed pilot for some overproduced TV sitcom.
rotten," People who hold musicals as dear and inviolate as church doctrine will brook no criticism of this film, while more dispassionate eyes will see flaws stemming from story values sold out."
rotten," A dim-witted, dullard of a thriller about hacking and terrorism for profit that has one saving grace: timeliness...Being current only gets you so far when the script is techno-babble nonsense and the acting is as wooden as the Sequoia National Forest."
rotten, A disappointment for anyone hoping the studio would raise the standard of the animated feature to a new level.
fresh," This sequel in name only is a superior pic in almost every possible way, and deserves better than the half-hearted dump -- limited theatrical exposure day-and-date with VOD release -- it's been given by Lionsgate."
rotten," There's nothing wrong with style for its own sake, but The Losers works so strenuously to be cool at every moment that it can only be anything but."
rotten," The reality of ""Jason Bourne"" is one of obligation and monotony, as if it's not Bourne with a gun perpetually to his head, but the people writing him."
fresh," This film is just occasionally a bit too cool for school - but mostly just cool enough, which is very cool."
rotten," It ambles along uncertainly, hobbled by the lack of chemistry between its two lead actors, and by gags that either try too hard or suffer from being barely there."
fresh," For Ayer, there's no romance in warfare, only endless brutality, and Fury is deeply immersed in a visceral realm of blood, piss, and vomit."
fresh," A pleasant, if forgettable, romp of a film."
fresh," [VIDEO ESSAY] a seamless balancing act. Equal parts true-crime exposé, dysfunctional love story, and Depression-era think piece, the picture underscores American police departments' longstanding proclivity for short cuts to justice, i.e. murder."
rotten," The concept is lame, and the execution is lame, too. The more the film advances, the less we care about the plot - or anything that happens to anybody, really."
rotten, An uneasy cross between a Morrissey record and a middling X-Men sequel.
rotten," Cretton works well in tightly focused emotional hothouses; handed a decade-spanning commercial saga, he falls back on predictable storytelling beats and easy ironies."
fresh, Enigmatic and lovely.
fresh, The Fifth Estate takes heed of too many narrative masters and ends up serving none of them well.
fresh," Schlock it may be, and sticklers will complain about plot holes, but there's no denying the mood of dread conjured up here, nor the strength of the performances."
fresh, All the possible tropes of overcoming in sports... and Matteo Rovere handles them with the same dexterity as the race sequences... [Full review in Spanish]
fresh," An often exhilarating, lively, magical and breathtaking experience of Pina Bausch's art. "
fresh," ... with the combined star wattage of Egerton and Jackman, Eddie the Eagle is a fun little movie."
rotten, A slick but mindless throwback to the kind of Western that reminds you what revisionist Westerns revised.
rotten, Smurfs 2 seems aimed at the six or seven-year-old in your life.
rotten," Has a too-many-cooks feel throughout, and coheres only in the final minutes ..."
rotten," The movie needs más -- mucho más. As Durán, Edgar Ramírez accesses the playboy arrogance he channeled for Carlos, but he's stranded by a timid script that doesn't give him enough private moments. "
fresh," films that understand that when Shane rode away at the end, he was probably just looking for a place to die."
fresh, Captain Phillips revisited. How do you say 'I'm the captain now!' in Danish? 
fresh," The horror of the war's direct effect, the fury of the resistance that it provoked, the self-inflicted damage to American ideals, and its over-all impact as a lever for huge social, political, and psychological fractures are packed in."
rotten," We discover nothing we didn't know, and little new about Berger the Human from the four portraits presented in the film."
rotten," With characters who are often as intricate and three-dimensional as an origami figure but a script that remains hopelessly paper-thin, Paper Towns is a disappointment coming on the heels of last summer's lovely weepie, The Fault in Our Stars."
fresh, Kevin Costner is an engaging and complex character that shows different depths throughout the film. 
rotten," One way to get through Baby Geniuses is to think about whether it really is the worst movie you've ever seen. Probably not, but pretty darn close."
rotten," Rather than exhilaration, this bilious film offers only entrapment and despair. It's about as much fun as sitting in on an autopsy."
fresh, Liebesman relies on his genre-film resume to keep events moving at a brisk clip and the motion-capture process employed to facilitate live-action integration with cutting-edge VFX looks superior onscreen ...
rotten," On paper, this could have been the antidote to an increasingly codified strain of comic-book movies, but in the end, it's just another high-attitude version of the same."
fresh," The animation itself is startlingly beautiful, as is the ancient owl world it imagines. The battles are complex and, in true Snyder tradition, heavy on the action."
fresh, It's powerful stuff. The story of the uprising is well told and seems balanced. It's also an important film in terms of cinema as it illustrates a major shift in the way documentaries are made.
fresh, his film has plenty of hustle even though it sometimes lacks flow.
rotten," Offers a few inspired moments in a sea of mediocre gags, fumbled opportunities and that great foul among contemporary comedies--unnecessary grossness."
rotten," There's enough of a glimmer that future stories can do away with the gristle and get into the meat of the thing, but you've got to get through City of Bones first which might not be worth it unless you're already invested in the series."
rotten," Phenom Quvenzhané Wallis proves her Oscar nomination for Beasts of the Southern Wild was no fluke. As a modern-day Annie, Wallis shines with her sweet portrayal. However, her performance alone can't save the film from being a dim adaptation."
rotten," Ultimately, none of this comes together in any coherent way, truly leaving audiences with an experience that lives and dies based on the craft of bloodshed and gore"
fresh, The two leads have a pleasant chemistry that elevates each exchange and build out a meaningful-and meaningfully deep-relationship that's easy to engage with and root for.
fresh, One of those wonders of imagination and craft that confirm your wildest dreams about the magic of movies.
fresh," ""Creed II"" doesn't pack the same punch, either emotionally or in the ring, but as with seven ""Rocky"" movies before it, longtime fans will still be cheering by the end of this sequel."
fresh, ...a bona fide classic that has something to offer moviegoers of all ages.
fresh," Holland is properly unsparing about the casual sadism of the German military, but she resolutely sidesteps the sentimental oppressor-victim division that distorts so much pop-Holocaust narrative today."
fresh, The real protagonist is an abstract but essential character to the film: the road itself. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh," For the birds? Or something more. In other words, the mass helpless perception through those very senses. Counting deep state digital surveillance, and the powerlessness of all of us against these doomsday scenarios for real - protective blindfold or not."
rotten," Witherspoon could have made something of Vanity Fair if Nair had reinvented the novel the way the makers of Clueless reinvented Emma. Instead, she exploited it."
fresh, One of Kenner's main points is that the debate itself is being held on false grounds.
fresh," What would otherwise have been be a rather banal David-Goliath story ... is elevated by Cromwell into something more weighty, and even existentially profound."
fresh," Oppenheimer almost entirely dispenses with the intertextual parlour games of The Act of Killing, and instead seems more content to let his camera quietly capture the story."
fresh," This is good ridiculous fun, with a steady stream of wisecracks to accompany the fan-pleasing one-on-one match-ups."
fresh, I just thought it was a cool indie film with a great leading performance from an actor we don't usually get to see in a lead.
fresh, A film which reminds us that nuance and representation matters.
fresh," Stylish and gripping, The Ghost Writer features a master filmmaker at his very best and a story writhing in personal vendetta."
fresh," He pokes and prods the audience, tilts at them sideways, he and fellow writer Amy Jump going out of their way to make things as obtuse and as weird as possible yet somehow always maintain focus on character and narrative at the same time."
rotten," Not even [the stars'] innate magnetism, comic timing, and outrageous gorgeousness can make this 14-year-old screenplay seem fresh, nor can the execution be willed into excellence by the hypnotic blueness of their eyes. "
rotten," The script is so bland it could belong to one of those ABC Family Channel movies ""starring"" the third lead from a cancelled sitcom."
rotten," ... the dances are juiced up with all kinds of snazzy digital effects ... Were the dances digitally created as well? Maybe not, but the suspicion alone is fatal."
fresh," Like Oudolf, the filmmaker sees the plants first, always, without denying the people or the other built environments around them."
fresh," More than just one of the best movies so far this year, it is a revolution in young-adult entertainment."
fresh," Another carefree, gleefully ridiculous, and comically violent romp through superhero comics and pop culture."
rotten," [An] oversimplified, overheated mediocre melodrama."
fresh," Crucially, we stay at the side of the conflicted Nelly, and Jones proves as powerful in nuanced moments of quiet emotional availability as in Nelly's few, stirring allowances to speak truth to male privilege"
rotten, Even the best-trained dogs sometimes leave a mess.
rotten," Neither the performances nor an ever changing storyline, where newer characters are introduced, help pick it up. An anticlimactic, emotional ending further seals the fate of this film."
rotten," Apart from borrowing from Garden State and In Her Shoes, there's a sense of Big Chill Lite -- made by someone with a much lamer record collection."
rotten," Rebound is an earnest, if faltering, first step"
fresh," Yeah, it's a mess. But what a glorious mess it is."
rotten," The standard action sequences pile up, interspersed with Wolverine's mooning about in a funk because he's lost the will to live."
fresh," It's less personal, and basically consists of a sturdy mix of fight scenes and soap opera, but it wraps its bulging arms and soft heart around you in a comfortable, squeezing hug."
rotten, The whole film is like a depressing nightmare.
fresh, The material is OK -- not great. And Wahlberg's as flat as a Philly cheesesteak run over by US Steel truck ...
rotten, Filmmaker Perry kicks Her Smell off with a long and somewhat interminable sequence...
rotten," What's amazing about New Moon, and the whole Twilight series generally, is how easily it becomes self-parody. "
rotten," Although a surprise twist surfaces at the conclusion, this twisted tale of friendship and greed is fraudulent, proving that following what glitters may have unintended consequences..."
fresh," To be honest, I never really enjoyed movies with Jackie Chan, but this really won me over."
fresh, a tour de force of giddy-enthralling cinematic trashiness.
rotten," Blake and Nobody meander through a wilderness as shrubby and nondescript as a '50s B horror movie, all to the accompaniment of an echoey Neil Young guitar score that sounds like something Wayne Campbell made up in his basement. "
rotten," Coppola seems to be one of those directors who believe that if you get the actors into the right costumes, the story will tell itself."
rotten, Didn't anyone stand up at a production meeting to say that the script is idiotic? That the movie steals unashamedly from countless other sci-fi movies?
rotten, Very quickly grows repetitive and groan-inducing.
rotten, The dirty documentary style of Into the Storm only calls attention to how fake its characters and situations really are.
fresh," The film has a disarming naturalism and spontaneity. Waititi never pushes too hard. He knows the importance of restraint, understatement and surprise."
rotten, Predictable life-swap story has strong themes of gratitude. 
fresh," Bardem's Silva is a throwback to a more traditional Bond villain, with equal parts creepy sensuality, intelligence, and psychopathy, and a touch of physical deformity for good measure."
fresh," A Most Violent Year is very good, but it could have been devastating."
fresh, The imagery encourages viewers to adopt a global perspective in considering the subject matter. 
rotten," From Hollywood's school of pop psychology comes Don't Say a Word, a Freud for Dummy's journey into mind-cracking."
fresh, Sometimes the best condition of mind in which to view a new film is mild idiocy. I was fooled.
rotten," An adequate thriller - complete with scares, red herrings and a nonsensical twist-ending %u2013 which exploits its Antarctic surroundings for all their worth."
fresh," If, as he has suggested, ""Spectre"" is Daniel Craig's final outing as James Bond, then it is a very snappy send-off, indeed."
fresh, Bracket out the ethical concerns of making merry as the body count mysteriously rises and Keeping Mum is an endearing hoot.
fresh," There are also some enjoyable twists in the tale, even if not a single one of them is terribly surprising."
rotten," It's a movie of ideas, but there aren't nearly enough of them."
rotten," Like Red Eye, last month's air-scare flick, Flightplan rides a jet stream of post 9/11 worries."
rotten," Al is mesmerising, but he and Holly could have done so much more, had more been available."
fresh," Nichols' screenplay expertly peels away exposition and drops us in a story already in motion, with scenes set up to infer one situation only to reveal another via meticulously parceled out fragments of information."
fresh," ""The Family"" may not be top tier De Niro, but it is excellent Pfeiffer and a welcome return for director Luc Besson. "
fresh," Wyrmwood is the kind of film that gives me hope for the zombie subgenre- it's clever, hellaciously entertaining and masterfully executed by Roache-Turner, who shows us that you can still find new and exciting ways to fight zombies. "
rotten," Pop in 'The Fifth Element' again. It was, after all, Valerian before Valerian was Valerian."
fresh," So beautiful, heartbreaking and unassumingly masterful from beginning to end, The Florida Project is undoubtedly one of the best movies of 2017."
fresh, Star Trek: Nemesis stands alone as an engaging intergalactic thriller with a lot of spirit-and some rousing action scenes.
rotten, Noble old killbot! They have a star--I just wish they had more of a movie.
rotten," While humanity has spent two decades preparing for the second invasion, nothing could have prepared audiences for this wretched, passionless cash-grab of a sequel."
fresh, Easily the best Disney animated film since 2002's Lilo & Stitch... a return to core values for the studio.
fresh," How much you feel pulled into her dilemma relies in large part on how much you can take away from Rampling's silent, thoughtful gaze ... I started losing patience with it ... her silent visage is just required to bear too much dramatic weight."
fresh," A reminder that the architects of a massive tragedy remain present and unrepentant, the personification of the evil men do and a warning that it could happen again."
rotten," [If you must], come for the jokes, the song and dance numbers, and the female camaraderie. Stay for... well, for those things"
fresh, Cheadle convincingly layers his outrageousness with off-the-air pain and pathos.
fresh," A bold, electrifying thriller. Madeline Brewer gives a brave and ferocious performance."
rotten, A thriller that cannot be taken seriously. Incompetent on every level.
rotten, Howl is one of the most artless art films ever made.
rotten," It's time to stop, I'm afraid."
rotten," Flesh-eating fish notwithstanding, Peter and Michael Spierig's low-budget schlock-horror parody brings precious little new to the undead genre."
rotten, The live-action adaptation is just as forgettable and inconsequential as the anime was memorable and influential. 
rotten," Handsomely packaged, the film unfortunately is also too well-behaved and lacking in psychological depth to really set itself apart from countless other WWII dramas theatrically, even if pockets of older audiences might be responsive."
fresh, An angry and personal attack on America's war on drugs contends it is a grotesquely wasteful public-works scheme.
fresh," Story-wise, this picture doesn't break new ground; this is a tale that one can find littered throughout the pages of history both recent and long ago, but the way Corbijn has presented it gives it a freshness and fervor that makes it worth sampling."
fresh," Killing Them Softly is an artfully crafted, occasionally very funny satire dressed up in tough-guy leathers and packing a knuckle duster punch."
fresh," Hichki oscillates between a strong-willed teacher and some kids pushing against the wall...It's well-intentioned and will move you, but it could have been so much more."
rotten, Peyton Reed peca por jamais conseguir definir o tom que pretende empregar.
fresh," Cruel comic mishaps may be this movie's raison d'être, but they are softened at every turn by the gentle humanity of the city's inhabitants, and by the unspoken sense that everything will turn out fine in the end."
rotten, A terrible one-man-army action flick. The 2004 version is far more effective.
fresh," Great acting, great filmmaking, half-realised idea -- but nonetheless entertaining."
rotten," While ""Carpinteros"" is strong enough in atmosphere and assembly, it's limited by characters who aren't developed with great complexity, and a climax that pours on a little too much credulity-stretching hyperbole."
rotten, The only plus point is introducing newbies to the big-screen Star Wars experience -- if the 3D price is right for you.
fresh," Occasionally confusing but inherently appealing, Woody Allen once again explores the concept of alternate realities."
fresh," Tries to rebel but it's as insubordinate as a kid wearing a Megadeth T-shirt to Church on a Sunday, but an okay break from saving the world."
fresh," Holzhausen is respectful but not reverential, portraying the museum as a living thing that's being cared for with meticulous diligence."
rotten," As a truncated work, it stands as a road movie tone poem."
fresh," As you'd expect from the co-founder of Studio Ghibli, Takahata has created a ravishing, technically perfect product and the hand-drawn, watercolour images explode with tender, humorous details."
fresh, The exorcism of bourgeois complacency is delivered with force.
rotten," Bland... something of a thinker, even a subversive one, but it's dubious that kids will pick up on the provocation between the pratfalls and the pop songs."
fresh," I could not possibly care less about football, and I fell hopelessly in love with this movie, and with the can-do amateur team it introduces us to."
fresh," n Summer Hours, Olivier Assayas's gently provocative rumination on family and possessions, a trio of siblings wrestles with the problem of what to do with the old homestead once Mother is gone."
fresh, Historical drama set in the early days of the French revolution is intelligent Euro eye candy at its most lavish.
rotten," These former damsels are given agency to change their stories, but the result is a lukewarm fanfiction tale with different costumes. There is much to be desired underneath the pretty surface."
fresh," Pacino in low doses can be fulsome, and this is 10,000 cc's of super-concentrated Al ..."
rotten," Uncomfortable in its lack of sensitivity, the awkward story never reaches the heights of the film's visual elegance."
rotten, Let's just say it doesn't make me feel like Riverdancing.
rotten, Initial hints of a Mean Girls-meets-Lord of the Flies complication don't come to much in this straightforward pic...
fresh," With I, Daniel Blake, his latest film and one of his finest, Loach's talent for humour runs through the entire work."
fresh," Brings a sheer sense of wonder and imagination that calls to mind vintage Spielberg, an optimism that is warm and contagious and another great female lead for summer."
rotten," Eight Legged Freaks limps along, spinning not a silken web but an extremely derivative, tattered one not likely to snare anybody's interest."
fresh," A tribute to excess, but in a good way, sort of."
rotten," Comes off as serviceable at best and officially sanctioned fan wankery at worst. In trying to freshen up the ingredients for a new generation, it just clunks up the batter."
fresh, Spider-Man 2 takes comic book yarns to a new dimension of possibility with its sensitive exploration of emotions that help determine one's destiny.
fresh," Lloyd is so fresh, so filled with fun and rebellion, that she carries us past the tricky parts on the strength of personality alone. It's one of the great debut roles for a young actress."
fresh, Star Wars returns to be fun again on the big screen. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten, A harmless piece of uplifting family entertainment...inoffensive but trivial.
fresh," It is this unexpected bout with humanity that gives the film at least some sort of emotional grounding, such that the vastly more ridiculous stunts and set-pieces, while exceedingly ludicrous, don't weigh the film down entirely with their CGI silliness."
rotten," The film doesn't teem; it just seems cluttered - a collection of scenes, and occasionally great visuals or gags, strung together by an inadequate plot."
rotten," You know you're in trouble when the cleverest parts of your movie are the ironic T-shirts, worn unironically ... (but) a bonus is deserved by the person who dug up the Pablo Cruise shirt."
fresh, Sharp and flawlessly performed.
rotten," Two full hours with the self-absorbed, miserable characters in The Dinner may be too much to ask."
fresh," A grievous, blood-strewn, sumptuously lensed portrait of a human monster who believed he was above the lawand, for far too many years, kind of was."
rotten," ...a routine police thriller that is, for the most part, slow moving and uneventful."
fresh," Garrel's second feature film as a director is as delicate and delightful as a well-whipped meringue: light, fluffy, sweet and delectable."
rotten," Like a mall, has long stretches where you see nothing of interest and a generally stale air to it. Unlike a mall, you can't just browse and then move on to a better section."
rotten," ""Sex Tape"" doesn't seduce, it doesn't surprise and it certainly doesn't satisfy. It only leaves you feeling a little taken advantaged of, as you take your walk of shame back to your car - and hoping you never hear from it again."
rotten," Even at a running time of two hours and 18 minutes, it's all pretty thin stuff."
rotten," An aimless, awful embarrassment for everyone involved, Venom imagines a world where a dopey Peter Parker-type was instead bitten by a radioactive turd. "
rotten, Where to start with all the things wrong with this film?
rotten, Run a mile in any direction from Fast and Furious.
rotten, I found the story unbelievable and very dated.
rotten," Though Blair's vision expands the action, the stage play origins are obvious in the films structure, which allows for a show-stopping tune at regular intervals whether the drama needs it or not."
rotten, An absurd soft-core yuppie fantasy coyly tip-toeing around the idea of prostitution and its consequences.
rotten," Neophytes may be left in the dust for lack of narrative connections and clarifications, while Pullman admirers of all stripes may feel short-changed on mood and atmosphere."
fresh," A cracking little one-hander (mostly) that rations glimpses of its well-designed beastie expertly, the picture will please genre fans who don't mind long stretches with no dialogue."
fresh, It's entertaining and once the geezers actually get off the ground the visuals more than make up for the shortcomings.
rotten, The nice bits fail to cohere because The Meddler is finally just too eager to have everything come out right. Its tendency to uplift its characters finally feels as intrusive and naive as Marnie's own overbearing I-can-solve-everything nature.
rotten, A sensitive but surprisingly unmoving portrayal of the friendship (based on a true story) between a Los Angeles Times writer and a troubled street musician living on the streets of Skid Row. Jamie Foxx gives a standout performance.
fresh, Torremolinos 73 successfully moves past the grainy closeups to show us love and even innocence.
rotten," Rendition manages to take an urgent, important topic and turn it into standard Hollywood melodrama. What a waste."
rotten," Mary and the Witch's Flower isn't trying to be anything big and sprawling, and it shouldn't have to be. What's missing isn't a bigger picture, it's one that's more consistent."
rotten," As Star Wars movies go, The Clone Wars is minor to the point of irrelevance, nothing more than a stylized direct-to-DVD shrug projected onto a big screen while Lucas launches two more TV series filling in prequel blanks better left empty."
fresh," Partly campy, mostly straight-ahead horrific and nearly always watchable."
rotten," As with most recent animated features not affiliated with Pixar Studios, Madagascar oversells itself with superstar voices and set pieces bloated with noise and undernourished in wit."
rotten, Disturbing thriller about webcam porn has graphic violence. 
rotten," It's pleasant, and at times very funny, but the meandering episodes mean that despite the long running time, the satire never builds to a payoff."
rotten," Ryan Gosling reunites with Drive director Nicolas Winding Refn for the ultra-violent, ultra-slow-moving Bangkok-set revenge thriller Only God Forgives, whose unflinching gore and crawling pace will probably prove equally off-putting to most viewers."
fresh, This straightforward yet insightful documentary pays tribute to its subject without resorting to hagiography.
fresh," A Walk in the Woods never indulges in the darkness that such an excursion might warrant, but it captures a rare, hearty chemistry that only two veterans of this caliber could scrounge up."
rotten, The squalor alone isn't enough - this would be a more affecting story had if it showed us what was happening beneath the decaying exterior.
rotten," 'Paranormal Activity 4' is such dribble. It's trite and cliche to its own fault, a lazy and cheap replica of a 'Paranormal Activity' movie. "
rotten," As physically stimulating as Troy purports to be in content, the mental aspect of this film has all the charge of a defective catapult. "
rotten, The result sets itself adrift.
rotten," It's not funny. Neither is it sad, or moving, and without any of that, The Life Aquatic is not much of a movie."
fresh, A soulful cinematic sermon elevating a sinner to sainthood for the sake of an uncritical Amen choir still in denial about the truth of the Mike Brown case!
rotten, A disturbing film trying to diguise itself as a quirky romantic comedy. There are indeed some laugh-out-loud moments; unfortunately most of the laughs are aimed at -- not with -- the misfits.
rotten, Poderia ter sido muito bom caso soubesse que tipo de história gostaria de contar.
rotten," The strong chemistry between Brie and Sudeikis makes this feel more cohesive than it actually is, but without a consistent tone underlying the jokes, it's hard to know how to react."
fresh, War doc sets itself apart with skilled storytelling
fresh, Most movies aim to take us out of ourselves. This one goes to majestic extremes.
rotten," Sure, it looks great, and everything billows, including capes, trenchcoats and Lex's locks. But strong visuals alone aren't enough to make a graphic novel great, let alone a movie with a production budget north of $200 million."
rotten," Grand, empty gestures and loads of CGI effects can't cover up pure schlock. Even the character's iconically cool trademarks -- a flaming skull and a fiery chopper -- are reduced to Velveeta slices. No, damn you, sir."
rotten," The movie is so successful at being so far on the fringe, it often isolates."
rotten, Thuddingly awful.
fresh, Andy Nyman and Jeremy Dyson's nicely atmospheric chiller... evokes the great traditions of British horror.
fresh," It's a painstaking inspection of parenthood, which is fraught even in less formidable circumstances... But it's also a contemplation of what it means to be human and, ultimately, optimistic."
fresh, This is a fun midnight movie.
fresh, An enjoyable and visually dashing computer-generated exercise.
rotten," Telstar is an embarrassing farrago, an amateurish, incoherent pantomime of a piece, stuffed with interchangeable characters, a sketchy, largely unsympathetic leading role, and - betraying its stage play origins - unspeakably stilted dialogue."
rotten," Devoted fans of the series may find themselves comforted by the presence of old friends, but Vince and his troupe are very unlikely to make new ones."
fresh, A unfailingly intense look into what life -- and death -- is like for America's fighting men and women. 
fresh," Overwhelming emotions and feminist prowess are drawn from the visceral, agonizing, and often-cartoonish images that hold this sick n' ferocious film together. "
fresh, An animated sendup of comic-book epics that vanquishes solemnity with the power of supersilliness.
fresh," Here's something refreshing-a great-man biopic, simply titled Marshall, that's more concerned with the man in his earlier years than with the greatness to come."
fresh, An unsatisfying epilogue and unexplained climactic bout of insanity from Pearce's character let the whole thing down.
rotten, Kaos has studied the John Woo playbook carefully -- using slow motion and spectacular shootouts and explosions -- but lacks the remarkable cutting that is a key part of Woo's work.
fresh," Life Itself is proposed as an accomplished melodramatic exercise, powerful, honest, with some very lucid dialogues, about links and their derivatives."
fresh, A delicious pastry of a movie.
fresh," An impressive debut by Georgian film-maker Gela Babluani - this is a beautifully shot, intensely gripping thriller that starts slowly but builds to a terrifically tense climax. "
rotten," Nobody in their right mind could have wished for a sequel to the awful 2011 Australian comedy A Few Best Men. Nevertheless, it still comes as a shock to witness how wrong this moronically mucky follow-up gets it from start to finish."
fresh," Thoughtful, discursive and somewhat mesmeric, Patience (After Sebald) is an unusual piece of filmmaking, yet Gee's film functions well as a solid introductory primer to Sebald's books."
rotten," On the Ferrell scale, Land of the Lost ranks squarely below Anchorman and leagues above Semi-Pro, landing right in that murky middle-ground Talladega Nights territory. Let your tolerance level for the comedian be your guide. If"
fresh," This is essentially Evans's vehicle. His version of Dracula is action-oriented rather than horrifying and creepy. And keeping that in mind, he manages, in most parts, to get his teeth into the substance of Count Dracula's legend convincingly enough."
fresh," T2 doesn't quite tap the zeitgeist in the same way as the first film, but what it does do is find the heart in a bunch of characters who were once defined by not caring -- so hopped up on skag they would rip offer their own mams."
fresh, This is a very accomplished movie.
rotten," The worst thing to happen to movies in the past decade--a bold-faced negation of art, craft, emotion and importance."
fresh," Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them does exactly what it needs to do, introducing new characters and setting up ongoing plot threads. It's certainly more nimble and entertaining than the first couple of Potter movies."
rotten, On Her Shoulders is close to being awful.
fresh," ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it."
rotten," It's misguided. It's not funny. And in its lame efforts to be irreverent and hip, it turns out to be just plain mean."
fresh," Like some manic slasher on the loose, Nic Roeg cuts compulsively, severing the natural arteries between cause and effect to expose a more irrational kind of narrative continuum...a true classic, worth looking at not just now but long into the future."
rotten," Despite an evident appetite for mayhem, however, Bay is not the right guy to produce slasher movies. Horror requires intimacy."
rotten," ""The Man Who Knew Infinity"" tells a great story. It's just that it's a little too by-the-book to make anything other than a so-so movie."
fresh," A seminal figure in modern conceptual and performance art avoids labeling himself and his work, in his own words. Still fascinating. "
rotten," Hopkins managed a genuine delight a few years ago with ""Last Chance Harvey,"" starring Thompson and Dustin Hoffman as two late-in-life lovers in London. But his new script has none of that wit."
fresh," Philomena is an amazing story, movingly told, which skirts sentimentality and rings true."
rotten, De Plama losses control of the tone as the story and its characters spin wildly over the top.
rotten," Allen observes Jasmine's allure and disease without penetrating her soul. That makes for a movie that is both intimate and disinterested, as if Jasmine were a flailing insect in a barren terrarium."
rotten," Though every location is photographed with an almost stately reverence, it is, yes, another mini-odyssey of black history through white eyes ..."
fresh," The twins -- ragged, cool-eyed and inseparable -- are this movie's swinging stopwatch, mesmerizing the viewer with the fierce back-and-forth of their romance."
fresh, Kind of like a more accessible The Big Short that doesn't try to talk down to moviegoers.
rotten," Tamara Drewe feels like the work of a director who tossed a bunch of darts at a board, hoping some of them would stick. None do."
fresh," Unlike nearly every adaptation Hollywood produces, the Harry Potter films, taken individually or as a whole, are worthy-epically worthy-of their literary source material."
fresh," A Hitchcockian stew of hothouse familial jealousy, sadism, and psychosis all tied together by one teenage girl's homicidal coming of age."
fresh," Yes, Refn indulges his camera to the point of luxuriating, but then, he has reason to believe you'll stay with him."
fresh," It is a film that the author's fans and lovers of mature, measured storytelling will embrace."
rotten," Asa Butterfield stars opposite a grumblebum Harrison Ford in an expensive, elaborately mounted, tedious film with one huge problem - it has no second act. You literally get to the end of the film and think: ""Hang on. That's it?"""
rotten, This abysmal piece of s*** deserves everything that's coming to it and more.
fresh, Overlong Ron Howard epic with Cruise and Kidman.
rotten," ""The Gandhi Murder"" begins with a claim to be ""based on verified facts."" Given the overall shoddiness of the production... those facts are probably worth reverifying."
rotten, Lawrence indulges romanticism in the dopiest of places.
rotten, A genuinely spectacular waste of money...Thirteen Ghosts has nothing going for it beyond its wildly excessive production design.
fresh," It's by no means an easy watch, but it's a rewarding and disturbing one."
fresh," By focusing on the strongest part of the best selling novels, David Fincher and Steve Zallian have delivered a stylish, mesmerizing thriller. "
fresh," While the individual characters can be very appealing and charming, no one gets more than two lines at a time to further any agenda or plot."
fresh, Cowriter (with Lauren Thompson)/director Zachary Donohue puts a new spin on the 'found footage' genre with this incredibly clever and creepy film that delves into our worst online fears. 
fresh," Elysium is loud, boisterous nonsense. But it is entertaining."
fresh, It's entertaining and fun and there are worse things you could do with an hour and a half.
fresh," Sony may not give a crap about Quarantine 2, but I wouldn't be surprised if the horror fans dig it well enough."
rotten," The movie is a comedy, I guess. It looks sunny and it's played lightheartedly. But what's the point?"
fresh, It's absolutely spooky how Lillard channels the Shagster right down to the original Casey Kasem-furnished voice.
rotten," A nice-looking, respectable but oddly unsatisfying family fable."
fresh, Lively and moving documentary about six women who survived the Holocaust to live fruitful lives that serve to defy the Nazis' extermination plans.
rotten, A fairly goofy monster movie that manages to seem bloated even with a running time of less than 90 minutes.
fresh," A fun, clever horror picture, full of creepy crawlies, things that go bump in the night, and references to everyone from H.P. Lovecraft to Dario Argento."
rotten," The characters haven't changed, great-but neither has the plot, comedy, or execution."
fresh, How could we hate or humiliate Lennon any more than he'd been trained to hate and humiliate himself?
fresh," An insightful new geek documentary, well directed by first-timers Lisanne Pajot and James Swirsky."
rotten, An inconsistent piece that runs from smug to infuriating.
rotten," The revelation of a gruesome back story seems, often, to serve as much for laughs as for dramatic heft in what is one of Almodovar's lighter efforts."
fresh," Tom Cruise stars at his forceful, charismatic best, while director Edward Zwick contributes the sort of sensitivity and power he brought to Glory."
rotten, Everything about the movie seems excessive to the material.
fresh," As a piece of storytelling, Embrace is similarly intimate and idiosyncratic. And that's what makes it so accessible."
fresh," Just like a really good novel, it gets you so well acquainted with its characters that they start to feel like your friends, and you don't want it to finish because that will mean never seeing them again."
fresh," ""Home"" is a colorful and energetic, sometimes even frenetic, film that children of all ages will enjoy."
fresh," This seems exactly the kind of ""based on true events"" tale that filmmakers go gaga for...The plotting lurches, bound by reality, making for a muddled though moving affair."
fresh, Director Campbell keeps matters bowling along and even manages to recapture something of the look of the earlier films.
fresh, There's no denying that Coppola has style to spare and has truly blown the dust off one's traditional biopic expectations.
fresh," here's humor, intense action and even some family friendly young lust...and it all adds up to a 3D animated feast that can play with the big boys of May."
rotten," Derrickson made ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" nearly a decade ago, a rather better example of this genre."
fresh, Ron Howard's relentlessly sunny direction is an unusual fit for this often fascinating portrayal of one of our century's great math minds.
fresh," The director's early days are thoroughly detailed here; if his later career is rushed over, an impressive trawl of talking heads (Gabriel Byrne, Cillian Murphy) keeps thing lively."
fresh," Well, it took five tries, but Tyler Perry has finally made a good movie."
fresh, An intellectually rigorous but enjoyable essay on the way the city of angels has become Hollywood's favourite location.
fresh," While the average chicken may hold as much interest to you as a dead duck, this film's chickens are well-defined characters that make you laugh, feel worry for them, and then laugh even more."
fresh," It's the writer/director's finest and most accessible movie in years, bitterly funny and painfully moving."
rotten, Whatever potential was evident in Soussan's source material is wasted on empty clichés and spoiler-alert casting.
fresh," The epic, unwieldy conclusion to the ""Dark Knight"" trilogy is everything that made its predecessors great but it can't rise as high as the bar had been set."
rotten," Jack and Jill is total bust, a stupefyingly unfunny and shamelessly lazy farce packed with cringe-worthy jokes and overt product placement. "
rotten," Here's a movie that I didn't want to see, didn't enjoy seeing and wouldn't wish upon anyone else."
rotten," If we define [""sinister""] as meaning, ""ominous, forbidding, portending of doom,"" the film starts well enough, with suggestions of dark and sinister events to come; but soon other words creep into mind: stolid, sluggish, tedious."
rotten," Gotti tries too hard to cram too much information into a small space, and you come away learning almost nothing about the man, other than the filmmakers feel he was a pretty stand-up guy."
rotten, Favela Rising can't seem to find its center.
rotten, aggressively mediocre
rotten, It's as if the whole Marvel thing got in the way of the indie movie everyone secretly wanted to make - a squeamishness that does no one any favours.
fresh," The Wind Rises may come as a shock for fans of the kid-friendly, pro-feminist, deeply pacifist Miyazaki... It's a big story, and in this landmark film Miyazaki is up to every demand."
rotten, This movie isn't nearly as smart as it wants to be. It's the dunce wearing a valedictorian robe.
fresh," An improvement on 1995's Pocahontas, but not as good as the classics."
fresh," Getting there isn't easy, for the characters or the viewer, but it's worth the effort."
rotten," It would be hard to imagine a film much sourer than Naked, but sourness is not a fault, merely a characteristic. Hollowness, now, self-indulgence, a sort of gloating emotional ugliness -- those are faults."
fresh," You find yourself rooting for [Garner and Ruffalo], despite the predictability of the premise."
fresh," It's a good thing Paul was written from a place of love, as it is absolutely the death knell for geek chic. "
rotten," Every gesture feels synthetic, from the back story about North-South separation to massage the emotions of the home audience, to the 24-style globe-hopping nuclear-terrorism premise."
fresh," An exhilarating tapestry of valor, selfishness, deceitfulness, and martyrdom."
rotten," Bordering on camp and loaded with lesbian undertones, this wretched drama plays like a high-school horror flick that trades monsters and mayhem for an overdose of force-fed cruelty."
fresh," If you think The Ritual is like every other movie, just have a little patience. I assure you it's not. Insanely creepy 'horror in the woods'. [Full review in Spanish]."
fresh, It's winter in Reagan's America...but wasn't it always?
rotten," [Haq] presents the story in a formulaic, tendentious manner, not allowing its human and ideological complexities to shine through."
rotten," Kicking off the summer with this flick I was hoping for more sizzle, but wound up with a lot fizzle."
fresh, From hot new French director Julia Ducournau comes a new breed of hybrid horror that draws on convention yet doesn't have a cliche in sight.
rotten, it's the supporting cast that takes control of the movie and makes the audience pay attention as best we can as Fast Food Nation falls apart
fresh," Morgen has made a fittingly unruly patchwork distillation of a messy, self-destructive life. Romanticism and myth have been cast aside. A tidy documentary would only be possible about a less talented, less tormented artist."
rotten," I realize that action-thrillers are not usually known for their Mensa scripts, but ""3 Days to Kill"" sets a new, all-time low. "
fresh," The movie is a kind of feat for Partridge as director, but it's Laurence who consistently surprises the viewer with an understanding that goes far beyond her years."
rotten," This period piece, directed by Richard Laxton, is shot in such a grim and grainy fashion you long to turn on the lights - which is fitting, because you also wish the filmmakers had illuminated the characters a bit more clearly."
fresh," It takes a while to hit its stride but when 13 Assassins finds its groove, this magically turns into one of the most memorable - and shocking - action films in an absolute age."
fresh, It's a lively directorial debut from Kay Cannon...
rotten," It does so much winking, it could be diagnosed with an eye infection."
rotten," After a promising start, the script begins to sound like it was written by little girls playing Barbies. "
fresh, Only those with a heart of tin could resist.
fresh, It's life-affirming to watch a trans woman direct a movie about whatever the hell she wants.
fresh," A beguiling set of variations on a theme, a gossamer-light étude composed for delight rather than dissection."
fresh," Moves like a bullet and jolts the hell out of you on a regular basis. This is the kind of film that, when it's over, makes you want to sit down and calm your nerves for a while. "
fresh," This documentary avoids sentimentality, shows modesty when it comes to showing the emotions of others... [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh," If God is in the details, then this is the most righteous movie ever made.Jim Carrey is the only man deserving to interpret Chuck Jones' animation."
fresh," Buoyant, pleasantly pulpy, invigorating doodle."
fresh," An intelligent, emotionally honest and satisfying film."
rotten," Miscast, misguided and woefully misbegotten, this clumsy American remake of the deftly delicate 1996 sleeper hit from Japan is too blah to bludgeon."
fresh," A tighter, more agreeable, decidedly more polished, and wider appealing movie that only occasionally drops into the traps of the last film"
rotten," Obviously, its heart is in the right place, and one can only hope the story and characters read better in Mulligan's book, but as far as ""Trash"" the film is concerned, the result is disposable."
fresh, Heart and humour in the countdown to Armageddon.
rotten," With a wildly inconsistent tone, this makes for an emotionally disengaging film that is ultimately rather unfulfilling."
rotten, At least it's infinitely better than their more recent efforts.
fresh," This slight, lightly charming comic adventure is most obviously appealing for the ""Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" set - though Bryson himself was in his forties when he made his journey."
rotten," a new version of incredibly stale material, with a modern shine, a little more gore, and pretty much nothing else"
rotten," All the ingredients are there for a pleasant pander to grumpy old white men: the craggy actors, the foreign bad guys wielding confusing technology, the kindness of beautiful young women, and the nobility of sacrifice. "
fresh," What finally emerges is a tender, moving relationship between two confused, lost young people."
fresh," Rashid Johnson's adaptation of the seminal novel isn't perfect, but it enhances the story's themes with powerful filmmaking."
rotten," Danny Strong's film suggests dramatic Tetris, and it leeches J.D. Salinger and his process of any mystery."
rotten," ...a nice mystery with a Hitchcockian, Dallas-type, twist, but almost terminally slow."
fresh, No other movie this year has provided as many 'I can't believe what I'm seeing' moments.
fresh," [A] bright, absorbing biopic ..."
rotten," Tickled runs a bit too long (at 90 minutes) and proves slightly unsatisfying in its denouement. The new, 20-minute tack-on, The Tickle King, helps somewhat and offers new, necessary details."
rotten," for the rest of us who think that a piece of cinema should be more than that, Lions for Lambs leaves us feeling empty rather than sparked by the zeitgeist the film attempts to capture."
rotten, This is trash of the tamest variety which elicits a few mild shudders at most.
fresh, It's not a terribly satisfactory capper to the Twilight franchise because it sets aside the strange undercurrents of desire and danger that defined the series and made it such a hair-tearing conundrum for feminists ...
rotten, The Future is a drab dramedy about thirtysomethings flailing about for self-definition.
rotten," Monster action with minor smarts...the fatigue factor sets in early, especially without much humor and only corny asides available to balance the onslaught."
rotten, Leave your sense of logic at the door or you'll be driven to distraction by annoying 'How come...' questions.
rotten," South Park is profoundly stupid, but given the times it has guts."
fresh," The Big Short is a crackling, live entertainment that elicits as many laughs as jaws agape that this could happen."
rotten," Any similarity to that quirky, hilarious, raunchy and imaginative Albert Finney vehicle from 1963 ('Tom Jones') is purely in the mind of the filmmakers."
rotten, The stories here suffer from the chosen format.
fresh, Moralistic thriller with a sincere plea for Great Britain to end its oppressive law that makes it a criminal offense to be a homosexual.
rotten, It is an irredeemable affair.
rotten," ... offers a fresh take on familiar material, yet too often its forced quirks feel inauthentic."
fresh," You don't want to see Rock the Kasbah. If you do, you're reading the wrong newspaper."
rotten," I think babies are like fantasy football teams. I have my own, which I love, to the point of obsession. But I'm not nearly as interested in some complete stranger talking about his own for an hour and a half. Much less four of them."
rotten," [It's] so slender that if looked at from the right angle, it wouldn't even exist."
rotten," From naked models draped in fabric, to private jet passengers draped in dogs, Valentino is a warts and all, fly on the wall insight into the life of one of the great fashion designers. Unfortunately in this flick there are more warts than all."
fresh, A lively and watchable documentary if not an especially enlightening one.
rotten," Once the novelty of the film's non-linear plot wears off, Killing Ground is mercilessly rote."
fresh, Engrossing story of two parts may be Witherspoon's best role yet
rotten, You get the feeling there must be a far better version of it on the floor of some editing room in L.A.
rotten, Jonathan Swift's witty 18th-century satire becomes a witless 21st-century star vehicle for Jack Black and his by-now stale shtick.
fresh," It represents, in a completely uncynical form, a genre that has been so absent from American cinema for so long that a large, loved-starved audience is out there that's sure to have a weepy good time with it."
fresh, The flat-out funniest horror film since Shaun of the Dead.
fresh, The sheer joy and pride they took in their work -- and in each other -- shines through every frame.
fresh," A gritty urban comedy noir, a scathing, Network-worthy disembowelment of television newsgatherers that will leave you craving a shower."
fresh, [Mangold's] examination of the moral complexities of his two main characters makes this an intriguingly timely as well as timeless story.
fresh, I think it's important that Lorentzen shows worldwide audiences the desperate situation with healthcare in Mexico with Midnight Family. Perhaps this will lead to charitable donations and reforms to improve the system. 
rotten, The action sequences are so slow to the point it becomes boring. A sin for the genre. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten, Didn't Thornton go through many of these same tropes in that similar mediocrity School for Scoundrels?
fresh, A breath of fresh air.
rotten," This live-action update of a popular Japanese anime film from 2000 has a heart full of mythology, but its fangs are dulled by an anemic script and clumsy action sequences that are notable mostly for an excess of cheese, not blood."
fresh, Clunky thematic exposition isn't enough to break an otherwise lovely film
rotten," Lilting doesn't have any momentum or any sense of ambiguity, once the setup has been established."
fresh, Satanism never gets old.
rotten," It finally gives us what Hollywood has been threatening for years, the movie nobody was waiting for: Airport '96."
rotten, Director Jim Fall's The Lizzie McGuire Movie is not a movie at all; it's a 90-minute advertisement for Hilary Duff.
rotten, Eventually it just stalls.
fresh," More than a decade after The Blair Witch project turned the mock-doc format into a horror cliche, this low-tech horror show uses it to chilling effect in this story of cynicism vs. things that go bump in the night. "
fresh," The movie is defined by Shannon, though, who finds a way to universalize the experience of being Elvis without totally downplaying the abiding weirdness."
fresh," Rob Kuhns's amusing but perfunctory documentary about the origins of the 1968 ur-text of zombiedom, George Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead."""
fresh," What ""This is It"" accomplishes is key to not only preserving Jackson's memory, but also to galvanizing his myth. Onstage, he still moonwalks, but there are new moves to be had here and a voice that is still strong."
rotten," Almost Christmas seems like a film that was taken out of the oven too early, leaving an underdone product on the table."
rotten," [The film has] a smug faith in the ability of its own speed, smartness and luxe to wow the yokels."
fresh, Things I never expected to see in a major motion picture...
rotten, I wanted to champion a sweet locally filmed movie and tell you all to hunt it down. Sadly I cannot.
fresh," It throws us into the action, utterly clueless about what might result."
rotten," The smart, surreal premise slowly, slowly unravels into schlock."
rotten," Shrek the Third, lacks everything that made the first two Shreks so entertaining."
rotten," Binoche and Stewart anchor the stronger parts of Assayas' script, but nothing can save such an ultimately unpleasant and disingenuous piece of cinema."
rotten, It feels as though it settled for mediocrity rather than reaching for something a bit special.
rotten," This appealing, fun pairing gives the film some promise--that is just as immediately shot to hell once the big plot hook/gimmick kicks in."
fresh, Un baldazo de realidad que confirma a los hermanos Dardenne como dos sensibles observadores de personajes marginales.
rotten," Baffling, non-linear to the point of near-schizophrenia, and despite all of the computer technology, sadly resistant to any kind of production design you could call innovative."
fresh," A film that manages to convey a sense of nostalgia and connection thanks to the chemistry between Dano and Radcliffe, and to its quiet soundtrack. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh," Además de la afortunada dirección, el que este episodio tuviera un buen resultado, era de esperarse. Con un presupuesto elevado, la mayor parte del elenco repitiendo y el talento histriónico de Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Ralph Fiennes, Helena Bonham Ca"
fresh," It's the kind of easy target that most film critics enjoy savaging, but I choose to look a little more closely at movies like this. Empty-headed and powerfully familiar, yes, boring and poorly-made ... no way."
fresh," The storyline is all over the place, and the action is too often manic, but at least ""The Second Part"" retains enough pop-culture references aimed at parents to go with the slapstick humor that makes the kids chuckle."
fresh," Hubert Sauper's brutal documentary is up for an Oscar, and it's easy to see why."
rotten," The tone is mawkish, the pace slow and both Sally Hawkins and Ethan Hawke overact horribly."
rotten," ...the noble patient, served up with heavy doses of tea and sympathy."
fresh, Everything else remains entirely the same out of either laziness or a fear of redneck audiences screaming at the changing world around them.
rotten," ...vulgar, emotionally violent, and silly...why anyone would want to sit through this dispiriting nonsense is incomprehensible."
fresh," As a postscript to the arc of the first three films, it's a fittiingly funny and surprisingly sweet coda."
rotten, There should be a separate genre heading for this film: time-wasting droopy fantasy.
fresh," It manages to be reasonably fun, kind of funny and just a little charming, and will be fine to watch with your Disney rom-com loving kids on DVD."
fresh," The modest pleasures of Going in Style come from watching three old pros expertly and enjoyably playing off each other. They may not be quick... but they have skills and experience, a point that applies to acting as well as armed robbery."
rotten," Despite its occasional virtues, it eventually reveals itself to be a film that is simply too long, too overblown and not nearly as witty or clever as it clearly thinks itself to be."
fresh, Unique in the manner in which it salutes African-American culture and unity while at the same time exhibiting an exalted openness that makes it clear everyone's invited to take part in the merriment.
fresh, One of the best performances of the year from Winstead...I encourage you to see it.
rotten, Aviva ... learns that everything and everyone sucks. Which we've already learned if we've watched any of Solondz's other movies.
rotten," A familiar lemonade-from-lemons period biopic or, in the case of the fashionista, a smart-suit-from-tattered-threads tale."
fresh, could have been the funniest and sweetest movie of the year
fresh," Despite its naturalistic trappings, McKay's new film (his first in 13 years), with its simplicity, transpires like a fairytale, one that concerns an undocumented deliveryman."
rotten, Tony Benn gets a personal and political whitewash from this fawning documentary.
fresh," Based on a men's mag article, Kyle Patrick Alvarez's debut feature is an honest, funny-sad portrayal of emotional dysfunction."
fresh, It's a difficult task to keep viewers connected to a sprawling series and to put together two and a half hours of solid thrills and surprises with a good level of emotional investment. That's exactly what M:I 6 has done.
fresh, Bubblegum for the brain.
rotten, The kind of piece that needs to move 100MPH from first scene to last for you to overlook its flaws. It slows down for too long to recommend the ride.
fresh," Premium Rush is little more than a 90-minute chase scene, but it's an often exhilarating ride thanks to adrenalin-triggering visuals."
fresh," The film is wonderful: uplifting, funny, tense and moving all at once"
fresh," There's no other way for director Rupert Sanders but to take the material very seriously and transform the geeky essence of the narrative into popular entertainment for a global audience. At that level, Ghost In The Shell doesn't disappoint."
fresh," Princess Cyd is a low-key marvel; an elegant, warm-hearted examination of the ways that we relate to one another whilst dealing with our differences. "
rotten," The Green Inferno can easily be dismissed as juvenilia, both in its sneering rebuke of political correctness and in its zeal for unearthing a horror tradition that should have been laid to rest."
fresh, The Rock's recent output seems to be made up of dusty old relics hastily cleaned as a last moment gift for a younger audience that may or may not throw it in the trash.
fresh, As a directorial debut the film is little short of astounding. It gives us one more reason to never forget.
rotten," Sports some good performances and is nice to look at at times, but it's ultimately both spectacularly ill-conceived and deathly boring."
rotten," The nostalgia doesn't quite convey, no matter how hard one claps for a computer-generated, Lunesta butterfly-like Tinker Bell. Old musicals tend to run long and come across as strangely convoluted."
rotten, Perhaps the best one can say for this bland concoction mixed by agents and the studio executives is that every bartender in Hollywood wants to be Tom Cruise and that suffices as an ironic subtext.
fresh," Love, Simon is so full of heart and emotion that you can't help but fall in love with it."
rotten," An unimaginative biopic , which follows the standard timeline of his career so straightforwardly that the screenplay is practically adapted directly from Tupac's Wikipedia page "
rotten, The 13th Warrior seems like a made-for-TV warrior movie without enough money to get really epic.
fresh," In the end, this is a story about outwitting rather than killing the enemy, making it a homage to actual intelligence and an example of the same."
fresh," The film is a masterclass in dramatic structure and rolls through Campion's meticulous screenplay beats with effortless elan, right up to the axe-wielding climax. Almost the perfect film. "
fresh," The feature is surprisingly honest and welcomingly underplayed, generating an understanding of the Mandelas instead of blindly celebrating their accomplishments. "
fresh," I've seen the film twice, gladly, and I can't wait to see what Cedar comes up with next."
fresh," Kitano has an enormous amount of fun goofing on Kurosawa archetypes, but here is a film with a song in its heart. (Yup, its a bloody samurai musical.)"
rotten," A small sphere of intellectuals will feel that Kubrick has said something, simply because one expected him to say something. ... Most moviegoers will only wish that Mr. Kubrick would come back down to earth."
rotten," No, the real problem is the seemingly endless round of male characters of middling importance, the list of which just seems to go, confusingly, on and on and on. "
rotten," Griff the Invisible is sweet and pleasant, but it is often a little too relaxed for its own good."
fresh," The film is an impressive tonal balancing act that gives equal attention to both its rapid, frantic thriller and its intimate, opaque character study. "
fresh," Cultural imperialism, the new crusades and the Christian Right wreaking havoc in Africa are unmasked. But this tip of the iceberg inquiry begs for deeper digging into US capitalism's economic designs, and how gullible US celebrity outrage kicks in too."
fresh, Ernest and Celestine is a charming animated feature inspired by Belgium writer-illustrator Gabrielle Vincent's wholesome children's books of the same name
fresh," A work of many moving parts, one to take apart and put back together again repeatedly."
fresh, You can't tell a tale of fanaticism's evil without violence; so violence there is. And pain; and grief; and sharp-clawed deprivation.
fresh," Un pasatiempo divertido y sensible al mismo tiempo, liviano y nada pretencioso. Quien busque una comedia sólo para reír, que busque otra cosa; aquí también encontrará lágrimas."
rotten," ...tour-de-force performances from Foxx and Downey, but they cannot make up for a story that it is largely commonplace."
rotten, The distinction between the depiction of violence and its exploitation is paper-thin.
rotten, Not as good as it's rep.
rotten," The plot announces that it's going to gyp us around, not because it has other things to offer, but out of the hope that we will let it off the hook."
fresh," Blending comedy with zombies down under, Little Monsters offers so much fun in viewing that it is sure to become a cult classic on the midnight circuit."
rotten," A false start for both Cage and Green, two singular cinematic voices who have drifted too far into the seas of commercialism."
fresh," Oldman dominates the film, capturing Churchill's outsized, blustery personality, along with a mischievous sense of humor ..."
fresh," The film walks a tightrope between Pythonesque satire and heart-felt romance, and generally keeps its footing."
fresh, Fans of The Proposition will have to settle for sublimely evil performances by Gary Oldman (as a murderous rival) and Guy Pearce (as a government agent) and a large quotient of gut-wrenching violence. 
rotten, A movie with a more sitcomic premise you are unlikely to find.
fresh," A strangely muted, dull effort, though still worthy of attention."
rotten, It's a film which stays glumly on the tarmac.
rotten, High concept meets lightweight substance in writer/director Andrew Niccol's clinical cartoon rendition of a not-too-distant-future dystopia. 
fresh," There are chuckles throughout, but it's not the biting, bizarre, black comedy one has come to expect from the Coen duo."
fresh, The movie has some astonishing visual effects.
rotten," Christensen...is such a fun, wicked, spiteful villainess that she keeps the flick afloat all by herself."
fresh, Literate and convincing.
rotten," I wanted to like Tank Girl, but I kept feeling that the filmmakers kept daring me not to like it, daring me to be un-hip."
fresh," Ejiofor, a marvelously focused actor whose range and intensity are given a faintly inscrutable edge here, holds the center of the screen."
rotten, In space no one can hear you yawn.
rotten," The Boy in the Striped Pajamas fails to illuminate history. Instead, it raises questions about the project itself. As in, who thought this was a good idea?"
rotten, De Bont botches nearly all opportunities for suspense.
fresh," Using archival interviews to show how enviro-concerns and oppositional thinking drove them, Crump sometimes moves too briskly, but the awe-inspiring imagery speaks volumes: this big-thinking art demands big-screen respect."
rotten," Handsome but flatfooted, The Wolverine comes tantalizingly close to working, which makes it all the more disappointing that Mangold comes up short."
rotten," The movie takes as its subject grown-ups' incomprehension of adolescent sexuality, but tells us nothing really new about it %u2014 the picture seems rather uncomprehending itself."
rotten," Saw 3D suffers from deja vu. Not only are they running out of new killing-machine ideas (too many seem to be merely some sort of elaborate drill apparatus), they're running out of reasons to kill people."
rotten, I'm glad I saw it but it won't stick with me for a long time.
fresh," How can our heroes be so fashionable, while everyone else [in Zion] looks like they just wandered back from a Phish show?"
rotten," A bloated, bombastic and ultimately vacuous orgy of mayhem that-if you'll permit a play on its heroine's title-proves a Major disappointment."
rotten," It lives or dies on its ending, and the final minutes here don't jibe with the rest of the film's cat-and-cat game."
fresh, It's Miyazaki's finest work! It's the best film of 1988! It's the best animated feature ever made!
fresh," Night Moves is one of [Reichardt's] most complex works yet, generating a slow-burning suspense. "
rotten," You still should see it for the performances, even if you cringe at what they have to say."
fresh," At its center, it has Carrey, whose nasty, catty Grinch is a hoot and a half."
fresh," The movie has to cheat every now and then to cover the story more fully (who has edited all this found footage together so perfectly?), but thank God it does because the film is richer for it."
rotten," [Bay] is hell on manly banter amid the explosions (""Just another Tuesday night in Benghazi""), and also moments carefully calculated to make you feel the horrors - and the heroics - of war. Emphasis on ""calculated."" "
rotten," ...a jump scare movie that frequently defies logic. The camera closes tightly on the faces of Moore and Holt, darkness obscuring what's lying in wait, flashlights and flares suddenly illuminating gaping, toothy maws mere feet away."
rotten," At the same time, Green is far too talented a filmmaker for this picture to be quite this unrelentingly terrible, and for everyone involved I can't help but think this is a collective low none of them will soon live down."
rotten, There's not much to Brüno beyond some very old limp-wristed clichés that are as hostile to gays as the people Baron Cohen mocks.
rotten," The good bits are like the seeds that end up on the bottom of bird cages, tasty tidbits momentarily visible before getting covered in crap."
fresh," It's hard to imagine an actress other than Huppert so artfully layering frailty and toughness, self-delusion and self-awareness, and her complex portrayal is an irresistible foil to Kool Shen's blank expressions and wounded swagger. "
rotten," As a film, it's negligible at best. It's somewhat shameful to admit that the film was saved by Alyssa Milano's body--but what can I do? I'm male."
fresh," There's a message to This is the End. That message is 'don't be a douche.' Well, at least it's better than 'Google is awesome.'"
fresh," Absolutely answers many questions, while finding it tricky to get into the mind of the man himself ... Revelatory scenes of the creation of Gurrumul and Hohnen's fourth and final studio album, Djarimirri, which was a truly unique, bold and risky venture."
fresh," The filmmaker's dialogue crackles with profane sizzle, while the moralistic underpinnings of his protagonists are suitably dark, twisted and complex."
rotten, Denzel Washington is fun to watch as a character who doesn't know who he wants to be in a script that doesn't know what it wants to be. 
fresh," While indignant in its stance, the film is never preachy, instead presenting a strong sense of morality that is difficult to ignore with-out resorting to unnecessary emotional histrionics, focussing instead on the characters."
rotten," Parts of it are funny, parts are suspenseful and parts of it - to put it mildly - are hideously awful. Horrible may be a better word than horrific."
rotten," ""Red Riding Hood"" has some moments, but overall it is plodding and dull."
rotten," On the evidence of this cheesy sequel, Neeson is in danger of becoming the new Steven Seagal. "
fresh," Carney's specialty is inching toward clichés, backing away from them, and inching back. He's not as pure as he thinks he is, but the footsie is very entertaining."
fresh," Cliffhanger is a device to entertain us, and it works, especially during those moments when Stallone is hanging by his fingernails over a three-mile fall, and the bad guys are stomping on him."
rotten," Promoting a stereotypical image of rural Ireland which would make Father Ted roll his eyes in disbelief, Leap Year is a sappy road movie and frankly implausible comedy."
rotten," The casting isn't the most tone deaf thing about the film - the script is. Though Ghost in the Shell purports to be a movie about identity, it advocates for the complete erasure of it."
fresh," The Illusionist has several tricks up its sleeve, not the least of which is Edward Norton's impeccable performance as a master magician in turn-of-the-century Vienna."
fresh, A Silent Voice is long and meandering by animation standards but touching in the way it addresses big issues.
fresh," It's Goodman who cranks the dial to eleven and steals the show, a bouldering force of nature delivering an utterly shit-eating performance. This will be remembered as one of the great roles from one of the great character actors."
rotten," The comedy revels in putting dumb and/or inept spins on cinematic formulas. It results in a shoddy movie, but one that is bad in rather interesting ways."
rotten," There are a handful of nice, intimate moments between Mirren and Sutherland, but this is largely an exercise in rancid quirk."
fresh," A powerful work which embraces the joys of life and the neverending spirit of imagination, equally heartwarming and heartbreaking, often at the same time."
rotten," It's the kind of roller-coaster Hollywood churns out seemingly in its sleep, oversaturated with effects shots and plot implausibilities. Ten minutes after you've seen it, you'll have forgotten all about it."
rotten," William H. Macy, Joe Mantegna and a number of other true pros manage to keep straight faces all the way through this woozy, self-important stew of lurid nonsense."
fresh," A powerful, complex drama and a long-overdue tribute to a true hero and visionary. "
fresh," Instantly sweeps us up in its passion, its electricity, its music, and characters to fall in love with. Lady Gaga is a revelation. It's impossible to believe Bradley Cooper has never directed before. I adore this movie."
rotten," Nacho Libre is a throwaway movie, but that doesn't mean it could not have been better."
fresh," There's no script to speak of, but del Toro devises every battle to wow even the most jaded martial-arts mavens; the dissolutions and implosions are beautiful."
fresh, Rocky and Adonis are back for a return match and a solid sequel.
fresh," Learning to enjoy one's own company is valued as much as learning the real meaning of intimacy, and casual sex (of the heterosexual, vanilla sort) is portrayed as a simple fact of life that is nothing to be ashamed of."
rotten, The direction and script is so confusing and so riddled with holes that you'll spend the hour after the movie discussing all of its problems with your date and friends.
rotten," It's all a mess, but the scenery is nice."
fresh," This is both a tribute to the brave resilience of parents and children and a paean to a past age of honest, old-school investigative journalism."
fresh," Given [that the film] is concerned with the rigid certainties of algebraic formulation, its winning formula -- mixing charm, low-key humour, on-screen chemistry and emotional delicacy -- is altogether more ineffable."
fresh, This deconstruction is so encompassing that the climactic explosion of zombie mayhem - revealing and awesome though it is - is practically an afterthought.
rotten," An attempt to muscle in on Luc Besson's Taken-style of thriller, this is an odd mix of French setting, American characters and British cast and crew."
fresh," Beyond the viral ingenuity of the marketing, what's cool about PA is that it's not just a fun thrill ride; it's an instructive artistic experience."
rotten," I left the theatre really and truly disappointed in THE PREDATOR. It ended up a bit of a shambling Frankenstein. Trying to serve too many masters, perhaps, and falling short of satisfying any of them."
rotten, The Ten never breaks out of jejune noodling and into something truly provocative.
rotten," The casting isn't the most tone deaf thing about the film - the script is. Though Ghost in the Shell purports to be a movie about identity, it advocates for the complete erasure of it."
fresh, ...there's something about the mood of this film that grows on one.
rotten," Moore's performance is undeniably exquisite, but any character study must bring us on a full journey. That's where Gloria Bell, for all of its assets and acclaim, stumbles."
fresh," sheer delight, the perfect synthesis of mainstream action flick and sobering philosophical musing on the nature of love in an imperfect world"
rotten," It has filler that ranges from the superfluous to the distracting and some inexcusably vulgar humor, but when Cat takes over, it is entertaining."
rotten," Legend of the Fist primarily functions as a rah-rah nationalist fable, and other than the sleek choreography during a WWI prelude and a ferocious finale, it's largely devoid of creative combat."
rotten, Heartbreaker relies far too heavily on the charm and attractiveness of romantic leads whose chemistry is lukewarm at best to sell a groaning collection of rom-com clichés.
rotten, Four to six movies are happening simultaneously in Elizabethtown and Crowe never decides which one he should be making.
rotten, A lot of hot-air exhaust.
rotten, I've never seen a movie as dependent on a fancy sound system.
rotten, Ultimately too tender and respectful. The story wavers at times between humorous character drama and serious spiritual yearning.
rotten," Despite its effective jump-scares and stunning camerawork, this sequel can't quite measure up to the emotional resonance of its predecessor."
fresh," There is one reason to see ""Potiche,"" Francois Ozon's mild comedy about a housewife's feminist liberation in the 1970s, and that is Catherine Deneuve."
rotten, Young love's tendresse has seldom seemed quite so irritating as it does in this largely improvised romance...
rotten," Like a self-help book for dysfunctional families facing the holidays together, ""Almost Christmas"" is a collection of sketches - not really a story - that explore awkward pre-Yuletide social situations."
fresh," If safety isn't guaranteed by the film's title, a viewer's satisfaction with this genial, warm-hearted movie pretty much can be."
fresh, [This] captivating comedy-drama represents one giant leap towards a feature film future that includes unlockable narrative strands and 360-degree perspectives.
fresh, Will please a select audience starved for grown-up comfort viewing...
rotten," In the shadow of The Stath, it doesn't stand up - and the original films weren't masterpieces in the first place."
fresh," Though Frodo's quest remains unfulfilled, a hardy group of determined New Zealanders has proved its creative mettle."
fresh, Mesmerizing documentary.
fresh," Beat by beat, Bug is gripping: It has that feverish compression of great theater, but director William Friedkin gets inside it, so it's never stagy."
fresh," You believe in T'Challa, you believe in Wakanda, and you believe - maybe for the first time - that the MCU actually matters."
fresh," The film is at its strongest when it's not taking itself too seriously, with plenty of laugh out loud moments driving a smart and entertaining action adventure."
rotten, For all the complicated CG wizardry and ostensibly visionary gloss...[Gravity] is aesthetically and structurally regressive.
fresh," A loving, faithful portrait of an era which was, let's face it, a bit dull. It feels like Victorians the way they wanted to see themselves more than Victorians as they actually were."
rotten, Fails to provide any sort of genuine social context for its violence.
fresh, Anybody who expects this film to be nothing more than the equivalent of flipping through the advertisements in a slick magazine is in for a surprise.
fresh," I walked in expecting a movie for thirteensomethings, and walked out feeling challenged and satisfied."
rotten, All three stories ultimately feel too glib and superficial to make any lasting contribution to the debate on Iraq.
fresh, He may need a lawyer to tell the nine old men on the Supreme Court he loves his wife. We see it in every frame.
fresh," It should perhaps be remembered that many musicals contain darkness, deep cynicism, and even high tragedy."
rotten," Director-writer Darren Aronofsky could reasonably be described as ambitious, obsessive and gifted. It's just too bad about his taste."
fresh, An entertaining portrait of modern womanhood.
rotten," There are only so many times you can use the word ""formulaic"" before your voice becomes nothing more than white noise."
fresh," [A] kinetic, incoherent but great-looking flick."
rotten, Chops together familiar ideas and design from many far better features.
fresh," Here is a frightening thriller based not on special effects gimmicks but on a dread that seems quietly spreading in the land: that the good days are ending, and climate changes or other sinister forces will sweep away our safety."
rotten," Too sentimental for art house crowds and too dirty for multiplex folk, The Good Heart is a movie without an audience about characters that never feel like they really exist."
rotten," Clearly, the idea here was to follow in the flatfootsteps of ""The Heat"": Funny ladies do funny cop-movie business. But with all the overacting and downright YELLING, comedy crumbles under the sonic assault."
fresh, Jelčić combines a finely tuned ear for dialogue with a sure directorial hand which can flip the film between dark comedy and pathos and back again; sometimes even within the same scene.
fresh," Le film de Guy Ritchie livre la marchandise, même s'il semble souvent pris entre deux époques..."
rotten, Every bit the lifeless blockbuster that its name suggests.
fresh, The single worst date movie to come out of the European arthouse circuit since Charlotte Gainsbourg become intimately familiar with a pair of rusty scissors in Antichrist...at once brilliant and impossible to bear.
fresh," I was struck by the peculiar magic of this film, even moved by it, once I gave up all attempts to understand it as a straightforward linear narrative."
fresh," Director and co-writer Lance Daly tells a blunt-force story in blunt-force fashion, draining the color from both landscape and denizens, and spelling out details in dialogue where he thinks it might be helpful. "
rotten, Blindingly unsubtle!
rotten, Close-ups of a needle penetrating gnarled toes and a mutant slathered in what I choose to believe is bittersweet chocolate make as much sense as the scary drawings of angry vulvas hiding in a drawer.
rotten," If there's a retirement home for pirates, Jack Sparrow might want to go on a quest to find it."
rotten," It has more to say than its predecessor, but the message gets jumbled in the process, leaving viewers wanting more-or at least a little more breathing room."
rotten," While Pegg has a good stab at lending the film some of his trademark knockabout charm, the film is as artless and difficult to warm to as its leading man."
rotten," Despite the film's flaws, the peculiarity of it all holds interests and carries through, until that rushed third act -- as if Burton simply lost focus and wanted it all to be over."
fresh, The Joy of Life offers a truncated and incomplete but a nonetheless promising start to that looming and hopefully brilliant career.
rotten," The problem with movies based on a single joke is that a single joke is rarely funny enough to sustain the running time of a feature-length film. And with ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,"" the whole joke is in the title."
rotten," It's a movie about clones, which is fitting because this is a clone... - cool action, but it tries to be too many different kinds of films and spreads itself too thin."
rotten," A half-decent comic premise gets beaten to death with lame slapstick, monotone performances and a hug-it-out finale."
fresh," This is a movie that will give you hope for the future in some cases, and utter despair in others. It is about some of the smartest, most dedicated students and teachers in the world competing in an international science and math competition."
rotten," The screenplay was adapted by John Niven from his own 2008 novel, and he makes the classic novelist's mistake of assuming that the best way to preserve the voice of his original work is by transplanting as many words as possible from it into the script."
fresh, Martin is also at the top of his form!
rotten," In fact, the theme of the movie might actually be the unspoken codes of masculinity, in which something-the rocky terrain, the Indigenous people, the untamed animals-must be dominated in order for men to feel like men."
fresh, A masterpiece before it reached the screen and maybe the highest praise that can be offered in celebration of this film version is that it remains one.
fresh," As Macdonald deftly presents a subjective viewpoint, Ronan endows her overly schematic character with authentic desire, resentment and willfulness."
fresh," For a generation that grew up with Flipper and The Day of the Dolphin, the tense, powerful new documentary, The Cove, is a horror movie."
fresh, Much of Intruders succeeds in the arena where fairy tales meet true adult horror.
rotten," Disappointing, frequently dull racehorse drama that's let down by poorly written characters, a thinly stretched plot, a painful lack of dramatic tension and a cliché-heavy script."
rotten," It feels like a desperate cash grab, with a terrible premise and some really jaw-droppingly bad attempts at comedic sequences."
rotten, There's nothing for Jim to do but sulk in a local bar on the corner of Nowheresville and Stuckforlife.
rotten," It's underdeveloped, missing vital connective tissue, not quite strong enough to live on its own."
fresh," It's not groundbreaking by any means, but it's the best family film out there so far this Summer."
rotten," More concept that complete movie, despite serious style from the director and the cast's considerable conviction. Sadly, there's no masking the plot's piano-sized holes."
rotten," Starting with the dog, Wang's warm-and-fuzzy story could have used some careful trimming."
fresh, Fox has graduated from amateur to modest professional.
fresh," Every plot point and thematic implication slots into place, but the pleasures of Coco are above all visual. I don't think I've ever seen a computer-animated film so rich in detail, or so dedicated to recreating complex and beautiful lighting schemes."
fresh," Maybe this material isn't entirely fresh, but Zwigoff delivers it with the snap of a quick punch to the face -- which is, in fact, the first image in the film, and a model for innumerable excellent sight gags to follow."
fresh, Melancholia hovers in ambiguity with riveting aesthetic prowess.
rotten," That Gloria expresses her own pain and her own desires makes the film's most important point, that history is not a trot through dates and period details, presidents and incidents."
fresh, The perfect setting and the outstanding work of Tom Hardy are the reasons to see the film. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh," Kingsman is not a film for gentlemen. It's for us, the great unwashed, bloodthirsty audience. It's an immaculately engineered, laugh-out-loud appeal to our own depravity."
fresh," Yael Melamede's illuminating documentary, (Dis)Honesty: The Truth About Lies, delves into the reasons why we lie and how we rationalize it."
rotten," An okay cast presents a plot with a few twists but the gruesome ones, especially for a PG-13 rated movie, are totally sadistic "
fresh," With grounded performances from Ivlev and Tyson, this is an excellent indie thriller that tries to do something a little different from the norm."
rotten," When the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year directs an equally miserable film the following year, you'd have a hard time believing it was just coincidence."
fresh," Prepare to laugh, yes, but also be ready to let Apatow take his good sweet time in telling his story."
fresh," The bright and funny first half examines issues affecting older people which are often ignored; the second half feels familiar and manipulative. But just as Charlie's van is held together by goodwill and window stickers, this just about hangs in there. "
fresh, A testament to how bliss and the spark of inspiration can elevate a film of any budget in any genre from routine to sublime.
rotten," Miami Vice, although stunning to look at, is ultimately a joyless viewing experience."
rotten," Early trailers made it look like a neon-noir cross between Blade Runner and The Fifth Element. Sadly, it's just another airless dud in red packaging."
fresh," It is truly charming and moving, without so much as a hint of overt sentimentality."
fresh," Kevin Williamson's Scream knockoffs aside, none of the endless parade of multisequel, blood-splashin' horror schlock has lived up to the high-quality, low-budget fright-filled fun of the original Halloween. Until now."
fresh," Tish and Fonny are young and in love, and there are parts of ""If Beale Street Could Talk"" where writer-director Barry Jenkins renders that love beautifully, as if it was the simplest thing in the world."
rotten, I doubt most of the target audience will be able to stay awake past the first half hour.
rotten, Screenwriters Scott Abbott and Michael Petroni have turned Rice's complex Akasha into a cartoon monster.
rotten, We're basically gawking at a commute.
fresh, Far more like Hemingway than Edward Abbey with a message that appears comfortable with species extinction than the publicity would allow you to believe. But Dafoe--as usual--makes it worthwhile.
fresh," It is, unquestionably, one of America's proudest moments, and before you line up for tickets to the new Adam Sandler vehicle, you may want to remind yourself of what movies used to be able to accomplish."
fresh," If XXXX were not Daniel Craig, the film's clever plotting and imaging would overwhelm him."
rotten," A depressing slog that could have been so much more, ""Youth in Oregon"" suggests that loving someone gives us the right to override their decisions."
fresh," Wonder Boys digresses so entertainingly, you forget how quickly Grady got into the mess he's in, and can't imagine where we might be headed."
rotten," The cast has ardor, especially Beer and Koch, but the script by von Donnersmarck can't match it. "
fresh, Ben Affleck does a fine job of playing a man without one in a compulsive cautionary tale for would-be Trumps and Gekkos.
rotten," Steven Soderbergh had his emotionally constipated Solaris, and now Boyle has this long night's journey into day."
rotten," Generally afraid to actually let you focus on any of his digital creations too long, lest the seams show...never stops to let you get a fix on what they actually look like. "
rotten, A second-rate horror from Paranormal Activity writer Oren Peli.

rotten, This boppy biopic pushes a wealth of outrageous incidents while never making anything resembling a point.
rotten, The film's major weaknesses is its screenplay. So many sequences lack credibility.
fresh," Matthew McConaughey carries The Lincoln Lawyer with sheer credible willpower and personality. McConaughey has to survive fitful direction and a choppy script, but he emerges with his likeable faculties intact."
rotten," Besides disinterest, the only emotion it incites is the emotion of wanting to throw up."
rotten," For all its zest and pulp elements, this is a minor work from the Chinatown director. It is told too obviously and lacks any of the ambiguity found in the first-person novel."
rotten, Poli-sci students may roll their eyes at true story of an upstart campaign for Seattle City Council.
rotten, Thank You for Smoking tries very hard but fails to succeed in creating a biting satire.
fresh, The film is ripe with infectious character and characters.
rotten," As the girls' mother, Kristin Scott Thomas is basically reduced to shaking her head, sighing and wondering how things turned out so badly. Indeed."
rotten," Eastwood and [screenwriter] Straczynski also give the story roughly 50 endings, and the director can be too melodramatic or on-the-nose."
fresh, It is everything Miyazaki loves and does best on full display.
fresh, A hilarious black comedy that proved too dark and too smart for its star's fan base.
fresh," It all builds to an affecting, insightful climax, deftly avoiding morality tale tropes while never failing to entertain."
rotten, A howling headache-inducer that features bratty urchins prone to torturing people and a color scheme resplendent with hot-pink bustiers and peeling lime paint.
rotten, Not once does it come close to being exciting.
fresh," The true measure of a good tale is in the telling, and writer-director Noah Buschel spins his yarn in an unexpected, ultimately satisfying fashion."
fresh," There are times when Hardcore Henry feels like the beginning of a brand new genre of action movie. Though to be fair, I won't blame you if the sound of such a genre makes you want to barf."
rotten, An unremarkable French thriller that feels like a Seventies Charles Bronson effort.
fresh, This grappling with faith-conducted quietly by people who share nothing but mutual respect-is where the The Apparition finds its heart...
fresh," Although a few of these may escape Fast's reach, there's no denying the ambition on display here: whether in the gallery or the arthouse, we'll see more from this filmmaker. He is, if you will, a name to remember."
rotten," Whatever they pay these movie stars to keep a straight face, it's not enough."
rotten," While it's sleeker and more sophisticated than the Chaney version, this new Wolfman isn't any scarier."
rotten, Part of me wants to applaud the movie for its go-for-broke styling. The rest of me is thinking that it could have calmed down just a bit.
fresh, The script for Three Billboards is undeniably extremely witty and absurd. Yet what takes the film beyond the point of being simply enjoyable is its ever- surprising emotional depth.
rotten, Taints the franchise the same way Saw 3D did five years ago...An insult to fans...who have spent seven years waiting to see how it all ends.
fresh, I hope Django Unchained will be appreciated for being a complex film delivered under the guise of simple pop entertainment. 
rotten, That it unfolds with a near-complete absence of finesse or subtlety probably won't matter a whit to a target audience weaned on Glee.
rotten," Nightingale is first an intellectualized puzzle, and a portrait of a man losing his mind a very distant second."
fresh," Wendy and Lucy is a sweet, slight and beautifully crafted film."
rotten, When was it decided superhero movies shouldn't be any fun?
rotten, It's painful to watch all that talent get wasted.
rotten," This tale of online revenge is amusing in spots but rarely scary, and its shelf life is destined to be pretty short given the rapid evolution of social media."
rotten, The third time around is at least one time too many.
fresh," It's a lovely oddity, and one that will probably hit home for preteen audiences all over the world."
fresh," The story is sad, but the mood is jubilant and the energy relentless."
fresh," It is very silly, and it may take you some time to tune in to the giggle wavelength. Once you have, it's very funny."
rotten," In spite of the incessant Nazi presence, and the fact our protagonists are hiding several Jews in their home, the film somehow comes devoid of suspense, which should be the film's most prominent theme, and yet isn't nearly as prevalent enough."
rotten," It isn't a bad film, but it isn't a good film, either. Basically, it's a movie that doesn't have a good reason for having been made."
fresh," If you're merely out for a good time at the movies, you can safely skip ""Suburbicon."" But true film buffs will want to peek behind the blinds of Clooney's latest directorial endeavor."
rotten," Some of the franchise stalwarts, such as Jennifer Lawrence's Mystique, are given too little to do. Most are given too much."
fresh, Gibney's film honours the persistence of those families who have campaigned with great dignity for over two decades to see justice done.
fresh, Your enjoyment will hinge entirely on whether you think the album is a masterpiece or a bore.
fresh," Hilarious and imaginatively crude with a surprising sweet and subtle aftertaste that prevents it from flopping, limp and brainless, into the sugary abyss of romantic predictability."
fresh, A highly entertaining account.... The movie belongs to Emma Stone.
rotten," No better than what you'd expect to find on American Idol and The Voice, both of which are a lot more upfront in their cynicism."
rotten," Despite visual snazziness, it's not a fresh enough film to sway anyone who has tired of its genre."
rotten, The most lighthearted movie about existential despair you'll likely ever see. 
rotten, Tideland sees the fanciful helmer overindulging his dark side with a slice of Gothic nastiness.
fresh," Like most families in this world, ""The Family Fang"" is dysfunctional and slightly disappointing, but it proves without a shadow of a doubt that Bateman is improving nicely as a director."
rotten," The movie seems to be conceived as a slow burn, but it's more like a faucet dripping lukewarm water."
rotten," If there is one thing that kills comedy, it's sanctimoniousness."
rotten, A tiresome misfire that's mortifying for all concerned...
fresh," Using only a few colors, Williams paints a deep portrait of a disturbed man whose lines of reality are becoming blurred."
rotten," At least it's not quite as disastrous a political biopic as The Iron Lady, which is a horrendously awful portrait of an interesting, divisive individual. Dear reader, that is as faint as praise gets."
fresh," I walked into a screening of the film a mild skeptic, and I left nearly in tears, and grateful for where writer-director Paul Weitz and a remarkable cast led by Lily Tomlin took me."
fresh," The film is a fair and, I think, a well-meaning attempt to cover her life in all its dizzying variety - hence the scattiness."
rotten," Zack Snyder's production company is called Cruel and Unusual Films. Anything I say from this point on is probably redundant, but here we are."
rotten, The one thing that I could call a high point is Neil Patrick Harris as Kyle's blind tutor. 
fresh," Though Penn's sympathies lie with McCandless, the director's camera is impassive, and the film's driving intent is to doggedly document rather than celebrate."
fresh," I've always loved this film, even though it is a class-A chick flick."
fresh, Is it a great movie? I don't think so. But it's a triumphant piece of filmmaking-journalism presented with the brio of drama.
fresh," The film kicks you in the balls with awesomeness, but is smart enough not to turn back and keep kicking you until you forget you're being kicked."
rotten, Ultraviolet cleaves faithfully to its comic-book genealogy with a plot unobstructed by big words and images that rarely breach two dimensions. Ultrasilly.
fresh," You have to admire the fact that, rather than turning to the safety of snark, this little movie sticks to its big idea: All you gotta do is believe."
rotten, A foreign film without subtitles - a movie whose language is incomprehensible to anyone who has truthfully been involved.
rotten," The movie screams, ""look at the pretty tall grass, look at the people frolicking in it, look at the pretty trees."" I like trees, too, but I'll go to the park to see them"
rotten, 'Going the Distance' is an occasionally diverting look at long-distance relationships that takes a few too many shortcuts.
fresh, A movie version that's as good as anything both kinds of fans [kids and adults] could have hoped for.
fresh," Xavier Giannoli's film moves slowly but with considerable power as it explores faith, doubt, mass hysteria and the desperate human need for supernatural reassurance. "
rotten," There's something amiss here, something that Eric Bogosian's frequent voiceover intrusions can't adequately explain, even when spelling out Philip's and others' inner thoughts and feelings."
fresh, This movie is blunt as hell -- but it's still effective.
rotten," As far as children's entertainment goes (and it is children's entertainment), it could be a lot worse."
fresh, It's the morally-cracked Humpty who provides the film's emotional trajectory. Puss in Boots is a fun feline frolic -- with just a little egg on its face.
fresh," The third-act developments feel a bit too hasty, but beyond that and some cheesy-looking digital fire, Predators generally makes for 100 minutes of run-and-gun fun."
rotten," The film promises a fabulous twist that never comes, and delivers instead some cutesy magical realist touches (lots of interior boy brain stuff) and a palpable lack of chemistry between Dornan and Gadon."
rotten," There's a certain stylishness from director Peter Webber (Girl With a Pearl Earring), but not enough good acting to make it stick."
fresh, The most focused Potter movie yet... it's all about puberty and death.
fresh," One of the most engrossing, interesting movies of the year."
rotten," It's either puzzling or vexing, and either way it's plain old disappointing."
fresh, The greatness in this film lies in the fact that the filmmakers managed to capture both Ginsberg and 'Howl' at its vital essence
fresh," Tense but never sensationalized action adventure about the first post-9/11 US foray into Afghanistan, an extraordinary culture clash and mashup of medieval and modern technologies."
fresh, What emerges is a portrait of a natural born shooter and an absolute savant for colour photography who warrants consideration as an auteur in his own right.
rotten," Slight and superficial, Spike Lee's look at the phone-sex industry through the life of one femme is completely from the outside."
rotten, ...so old-fashioned it even carries a troubling dose of old-fashioned sexism.
fresh, One of the absolute masterpieces of populist cinema.
fresh," The film starts with hesitation as if, like its protagonist, it wanders between laughter and tears, between seriousness and the comic wink. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh," Norman's thoughtful dramatic construction, built around a central symbol of a pair of shoes, addresses politician's voracious desire to 'go places,' ever outpacing forethought of where that ambition will take them..."
rotten," If this is a tribute, it's a crass and clumsy one."
rotten," The Prodigy never seems to work, even on its own terms. But that's difficult to say, namely because it's nearly impossible to pin down for certain what those terms are. "
fresh," While there's some crater-sized flaws if you want to be nit-picky, this is Bay's finest, earnestly entertaining film and an easy crowd pleaser."
rotten, Its originality sucker punches you in the face and you barely have time to recover.
rotten," [Director] Waititi's obviously a talent, but here he seems to be trying too hard to not try too hard; he's undermining the cleverness of the writing with the thudding hulk of its delivery."
rotten," Sloppy, overheated, sometimes involving, ultimately shallow. Read the book--skip the movie."
fresh," In The Music of Strangers, the sounds these gifted artists make are the truest expressions of themselves."
fresh," It is a bygone hallucinatory dream location steeped in melodrama, which reveals contemporary truths as it embraces a ferocious fictional construct."
fresh, Entertaining enough as it passes by but you don't believe a word of it.
fresh," A fun ride that NFL fans, and especially Cleveland Browns fans, will get a kick out of."
fresh," Farhadi does not choose picturesqueness, but continues to do what suits him best: conflicts between characters that enter into a difficult terrain when dealing with deep ethical crises. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten," Aimed at adults more than kids, this animated feature is only intermittently funny, skewering sibling rivalry."
rotten," Sincere Austen devotees -- or Janeites, if you want to get bubblegum about it -- won't find much in common with this modern-day Jane."
fresh," It's a harrowing, sensitively realized study of cruelty, revenge and post-war retribution that ranks high among films about the cost of war and its continuing damage to humanity."
fresh, The special effects in this movie are fantastic...It just looks dope...seamless. 
rotten," Dark, creepy story lacks Yuletide spirit."
rotten, This ATM-set horror film fails to dispense sufficient thrills.
rotten," A talky bore that reduces the original film's pontificating -- about the nature of 'reality' -- to windy, fortune-cookie philosophizing."
fresh," The film suffers from a second-half degeneration into CGI battles devoid of human interest - but it's still a high-speed, energetic, must-see action flick."
rotten," We don't have much space to tell you about Glitter, so we'll be blunt. This star vehicle for singer Mariah Carey is primarily a showcase for her breasts."
fresh," Like the holiday season itself, the movie overwhelms you, but in an agreeable way."
rotten, Feels pretty low-rent despite the amazing CGI.
rotten," The eerie wood was exquisitely designed. Disastrously, what goes on there suggests a Californian mall during spring break."
rotten," Part of the problem is the computer-generated Hulk. It's OK in the early going, when the big green guy is mostly hidden by darkness or smoke. But in the light of day he looks cartoonish."
rotten, There isn't one genuine person or moment within sight.
rotten," Borrows the tone, story, characters and humor of ""Kick-Ass,"" only this time in a 007 world instead of Batman's. Nearly everything it does, it does poorly: This one is ""Weak-Ass."""
fresh, Studio 54 is resonant because it offers such a reasonable and poignant answer.
fresh," A plea for compassion for a people suffering from poverty, illiteracy, and religious zealotry."
rotten," It is offensive on so many levels. First, let's just call SuperBabies what it is: child abuse."
rotten," The Stepford Wives (is) . . . bright and entertaining, but seems that, with the assembled cast and the talent behind the camera, much potential was wasted."
fresh," Stunningly, even hypnotically shot - from the world's largest landfill in Kenya, to the most polluted city in Russia (Norilsk, Siberia) to tons of tusks representing 10,000 dead elephants. A hard doc to walk away from unaffected."
rotten, A kind of Canadian World War I version of Pearl Harbor recast with TV actors and made on a tenth of the budget - yet for all that more endearing than Pearl Harbour.
fresh," ""Prometheus"" is a cinematic masterpiece with beautifully haunting visuals and an epic score. Instead of spoon-feeding the audience, Scott allows you to think for yourself!"
rotten, The film is a modest vehicle for large talents and should have earned its funding as a matter of product placement.
fresh," So the unlikely allies: A robot hater, a robot lover and a robot, all team up to solve the case. It's kinda cute."
fresh, [The] most important thing elevating Pariah is the outstanding performance of Adepero Oduye.
fresh," No doubt, life is tough in the wild but, this being a Disney flick, it's loving too and even comes with a kiddie-friendly narrative that's easy to summarize and hard to dispute."
rotten," A watery diversion in the Brazilian rainforest apart, this noisy, repetitive, nonsensical franchise-extender is a turtle waste of time."
rotten, This isn't a very distinguished film but it's likely to be remembered for its central performance.
fresh," Sometimes it's nice to sit back and enjoy the fireworks, and this movie has lots of fireworks."
fresh," Decent enough as an action pic but sorely needing some Schwarzenegger ""magic."" (Full Content Review for Parents also available)"
rotten, Bayer's stylish visual direction does little to detract from the fact this is essentially the same movie with far too many visual nods and little to differentiate it or set it apart from the original.
rotten, Disappointingly straight-forward. Not as much silly fun as you might hope for. 
fresh, It's lovely to watch how Fleming finds a way to express verse in animation.
fresh," Takashi Miike has a style that definitely sets this one apart from the all of the American ""stalker chick"" films."
fresh, Rivette's claim to the status of a key innovator in contemporary cinema began with this film.
rotten," Pierce Brosnan and Emma Thompson...make a charming couple. But their best efforts can't save Joel Hopkins' weak script,...which he also directed, clumsily."
fresh," Honest and free-spirited, this romantic comedy is filled with genuine and uncomfortable moments that can only come when a trio of talented actors ... are invited to make it up as they go along."
fresh," Robert Redford and Jane Fonda are once again a couple, now as widowers... [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten," Unless you enter a Giacometti fan, you're doubtful to emerge as one, or to feel any closer to the artist's life."
rotten, Get On Up comes off like a checklist guide of how not to make a quality biopic.
fresh," Think of EAT, PRAY, LOVE which has a similar sort of journey and this is so much better than that. "
fresh," Judd Apatow's film exposes the boundaries of the romantic comedy genre, and the roles  of men and women within it, in a way that challenges the audience."
fresh," Whatever the movie's flaws, it's a great Rabelaisian entertainment whose grimy pleasures can't be denied."
rotten, The jazzy jump cuts and dissolves and cutesy imagery of the opening give way to long talks in a pup tent about what really bothers kids today.
rotten," As a whole, it does not quite work, especially at the end, when Mr. Chan tries for a Shakespearean climax of filial rebellion and paternal rage."
rotten," You'll jump a few times in this film - it's impossible not to, given the deafening digital stabs of sound - but this just rehashes a clutch of cliches, including a borrowing from The Babadook."
rotten," Once Lombard starts throwing stilettos, you know it's time to get off the line."
rotten," Isn't all that different from any number of old Adam Sandler pictures. That's to say that it's not very good, and you probably won't find it terribly funny."
rotten, [The] sense of monotony ultimately dooms this pic about the doom of Camelot.
rotten," Just when the movie seems to be hitting its stride, Blomkamp and Tatchell fall back on the reliable and the expected."
rotten, ... a mildly unsettling but never truly frightening puzzle of a thriller that develops only intermittent tension as it seeks to find a personality of its own.
fresh," A movie that could have been bold and iconic, but instead settles for good enough."
fresh," So witty, riveting, and drop-dead gorgeous that moviegoers may forget to notice that they can't hear the dialogue."
fresh," Del Toro's influence is apparent in the CGI of the bulbous-headed goblins, but the story has none of the shiver-inducing otherness of Pan's Labyrinth."
fresh," As an orca trainer who loses her legs, Cotillard is astonishing, as is Schoenaerts as a boxer who helps restore her sexual identity. Audiard's hypnotic film means to shake you, and does. "
rotten," There's no sense of reality, no feel of the streets, none of the raw zest and spark that spilled out of Biggie's music. This is the type of biopic Hollywood made in the '40s about people like Johann Strauss or Cole Porter: phony to its bones."
fresh, The Little Hours isn't necessarily memorable film... but at least there are some good laughs to be had. 
rotten," The only way to even potentially sell any of this was to play it so straight that it hurts a little, and Akiva Goldsman and crew did that, even when it broke the film."
rotten," Zemeckis is a capable director, so despite the misguided concept, the movie is anything but inept."
rotten," Another year has passed, and so, as with the cold inevitability of death, another Adam Sandler movie is upon us."
fresh," Supporting Characters tends to meander pleasantly from scene to scene, relying on the testy rapport between its two lead actors."
rotten," Dull, entirely too British, somewhat miscast, weak villains and the tone's off -- very Guy Ritchie, in other words. "
fresh, The end result is a better-than-expected dramedy that boasts a seriously striking lead performance...
fresh," The only realism that matters here is the emotional kind, and while Myers and Whittet have a strong feeling for everyday teen humiliation, they're also willing to go deeper."
fresh, The most fun consenting adults can legally have in a movie theater this summer.
rotten," Genesis often feels like a badly-stitched collage of other sci-fi movies, and while that can often still make for decent entertainment for anyone who likes that kind of thing, Grant and Hannah aside, this is an unremarkable effort."
rotten, Mostly Le Mediocre.
rotten," Inevitably, the movie spends a lot of time getting ready for the climactic showdown. But it's so chaotic and protracted as to lose much of its punch."
rotten," A Mighty Heart is not a bad film, but it was made at a bad time."
rotten," Apart from the evocative title, which is a great nod to '50s drive-in fare, the film is as predictable as a meal beneath the golden arches."
fresh," Come for evil, stay for the cookie robots."
rotten," A painfully unfunny, overly familiar send-up of recent horror franchises."
fresh," Hardy and Theron make a dynamite team, but Theron is the film's bruised heart and soul. So get prepped for a new action classic. You won't know what hit you. "
fresh, Its makers know all too well how to fully exploit the power of a catchy pop song.
rotten, The film never takes us in far enough.
fresh," Bewildering, darkly hilarious, something of an endurance test, and made with such epic scale and precision that it's also breathtaking."
rotten," Got to hand it to Biller - she might have made a ""bad"" movie, but it's never boring."
rotten, Historical adventure is a fun romp for tweens and up.
fresh," It's well worth a trip to your local cinema to check out Terminator 2: Judgment Day, again or for the very first time."
fresh," Highly enjoyable, even if you're not a huge tennis fan."
rotten, Darkness Falls has pushed my tolerance for Hollywood horror movies to the edge.
fresh," Ultimately, the plot feels second to a well-executed, beautifully shot look at various struggles around class, opportunity and crushing rural poverty."
fresh, Joanna Hogg's intimate portrait of married life is her finest offering yet.
fresh, The Thomas Crown Affair is a fun and lively thriller!
rotten," It's a tremendously goofy picture, but one delivered without hesitation."
fresh," Kiki is at that difficult age where she teeters constantly brazen overconfidence and frustrating self-doubt. It's an age that many parents fear, but it's handled gracefully in Kiki's Delivery Service."
fresh," [Director] Derek Cianfrance's picture ends up overwrought and exhausting, but the performances of Fassbender, Vikander, and Rachel Weisz as the third person in the marriage, raise this handsomely shot picture to above average."
fresh, Pitch Perfect proves no one is too cool for the perfect pop song.
fresh," In the increasingly crowded field of movies based on urban dance, How She Move stands out as a well-written and well-acted drama with an appeal that reaches beyond dance fanatics."
rotten, This film assumes that an idea for a joke is the same thing as an actual joke...so shoddily written that the clothes are meant to stand in for real punchlines.
rotten," Jackie Chan is credited as ""Excetutive Producer"" [sic] in the opening credits. That pretty much tells you the amount of effort that went into this film, because Bleeding Steel is one of the worst films in Jackie Chan's career."
fresh," Satisfying without being more than slightly breathtaking, a hugely appealling broad-strokes action movie that nevertheless feels that, given everything, it should have a bit... more."
fresh," You may not like him much. But you'll find yourself rooting for ""Napoleon Dynamite."""
fresh, The film's final shot goes straight to the story's heart and the spectator's. Amazing grace. Now at last we know what those words mean.
rotten," Harrelson and Dern's efforts aside, Wilson is indie ennui at its emptiest, a vessel of misshapen wit with a hole in the bottom."
rotten, This would've made for a great TV serial.
rotten, Norton looks tortured and old before his time as the humourless Eisenheim.
fresh, One of the year's most affecting documentaries
fresh," Modern, gritty, action packed and led by a leading lady who can kick-ass and bring depth with equal power."
fresh, [Director] Morten Tyldum's film is an instrument of precision... [Full review in Spanish]
fresh, Miller has gone from relatively small-scale subjects into immensity with a delight called The Turandot Project.
fresh," Featuring a bittersweet score by Nick Cave, Tender captures a beautiful sense of the power and peace that comes from what it feels like to belong, even in death."
rotten, I can get partially behind any movie that commences with Michael Lonsdale greedily and noisily chomping into a moist leg of pheasant.
rotten," Desperately avoiding the risk of even a half-second of boredom, the movie is wall-to-window-to-door noise, babbling, and jokes (the first minute sees the first fart gag), and demographically it's a hard-sell shotgun spray."
fresh," When you throw in the extravagant sets, costumes and visual effects, it's as if you're watching a moving painting. New York in the 1920s could not look any more beautiful."
rotten, Nicolas Cage's latest descent into career hell. Oh the horror!
fresh, Earnest and occasionally engrossing.
fresh, The actors demonstrate such unmatchable Englishness that the movie -- a kind of End of the Affair without the religious instruction -- takes on the gleam of a cultural artifact.
rotten," Part heist film, part action thriller, part murder mystery, the movie is punishingly violent (in one scene, the camera lingers over squashed body parts after a drug agent is hit by a train). The ugliness is so pervasive it becomes perversely fascinating."
fresh," The scares in V/H/S/2 are totally different and more jump oriented than the eerie, slow builds in the original."
fresh, It is not an uplifting watch - but it is an interesting study of what happens when the past remains unprocessed. 
rotten," Stories and characters have always been the backbone of the best Pixar films, and here it's obvious that this was a script done by committee. Literally. "
rotten," Dishonest, manipulative and ultimately infuriating ..."
rotten," David Feeney and John Quaintance's script is scattershot and silly (beginning with that sniggering double-entendre title), and Anne Fletcher's direction is often sloppy."
fresh," Mines the comic possibilities of the classic setup of introducing the fiancé to the family, with results that are playful, charming and surprisingly thoughtful."
fresh, The Meddler is a delightful film with an emotional honesty that can be traced back to the real-life mother of writer/director Lorene Scafaria.
rotten," ""Just don't think,"" someone suggests. Good advice for watching the movie, too."
fresh, ...a garden of details. [Full review in Spanish] 
fresh," Watchable, and on a certain level, it's quite enjoyable."
fresh, Though Beatriz At Dinner goes for its share of low blows against the vapidly white and well-to-do ... its small pleasures lie in the way it sidesteps cheap caricature.
fresh," At first glance Walter isn't a guy you want to spend two hours with. But by the end of the film, you don't want to see him go. Jenkins is like that: He sneaks up on you and steals your heart with light-fingered skill."
rotten," [Max] Reid's direction is nearly incoherent in places, a relief from the coherent passages. The acting generally suits the material. "
rotten," In The Warlords, war is heaven. In fact, it makes everything else seem tedious by comparison."
fresh, George Clooney's deliberately ambiguous character Ryan Bingham is a poster boy for America's lack of ethical direction in a thought-provoking satire that doesn't swing its hammer of simmering revolution hard enough.
rotten," Garner deserves better than grisly, tone-deaf revenge film. "
rotten," The visuals are stunning, as you would expect, but characterisation is weak, and Depp's turn is one bout of lunacy too far."
fresh," Farhadi not only has a gift for complicated and elegantly crafted human drama, he understands the way people think and feel, the way they make choices and are forced to live with the consequences of those choices. "
rotten," Dull and perfunctory, this is a crime thriller that sets itself up as a revenge story but can't manage to drum up any excitement or suspense, and precious little revenge, either."
fresh," Gere's very good at making Robert's compromises seem more human than horrid. He portrays the philanthropic, philandering patriarch with his customary twinkle."
fresh," A spirited, if chaotic, fantasy adventure that pilfers the best bits from Indiana Jones and gives them a distinctly Gallic flavour."
rotten, A rather poorly directed and edited movie about a mother struggling to raise her son in a world she doesn't quite understand or embrace.
fresh," There is not a dull moment, not a single false step in this picture. ""The Man Who Knew Infinity"" is a powerful story that will stand on its own merit. "
rotten, A lackluster teen scream pic. A satisfyingly scary movie could be made from a Ouija board's inspiration. But this one isn't it. 
fresh, Its visual style and pacing make as much of an impression as the head-shaking story.
fresh," The pace is breakneck, and the animation -- though still primitive -- makes good use of the full width of the screen."
rotten," Spears, arrows, rocks rain down on us - or out at us - while the story and characterisation stand rigid in their starting blocks."
rotten," The movie could have been much improved by slicing a few frames from each shot, and reining in Rust's weirdness just a bit%u2014so as to not contribute to the lumbering, hallucinogenic feel of his initial characterization."
fresh, An immersive mother-daughter story that vividly explores emotional literacy.
rotten, There is nothing presidential in Devon Terrell's very entertaining portrayal of Barry (and he is only called Barry in this film -- Barack Obama is too grand and complicated a name for this easygoing fellow).
fresh, The best heist film in years. 
fresh," 'No worries, Lilly,' said Jen. 'New York's underclass will lay down end-to-end and form a bridge to safety.'"
fresh, For family film lovers that don't look for too complex characters. This rescue film is about brotherhood and love promises. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh, The writer-director tells the story with verve and small-budget ingenuity.
rotten," Despite its arty veneer and its ostensibly political edge, Circumstance seems more interested in titillation than revelation."
rotten, already submitted
fresh, [An] endearing love poem.
fresh," But for all the film's breezy romance, [Nancy] Meyers exposes the deeper feelings that are summoned when two more-than-middle-aged people find themselves ``overwhelmed'' by love. "
rotten, Never pulls you into its weird story.
fresh," A complex, accomplished genre hybrid that should alter Jordan Peele's business card."
rotten," Good People might have been better titled Dumb People, or at least People Who Have Never Seen A Movie In Their Entire Lives."
rotten, Less like a triumphant homecoming than the last gasp of a flatlining franchise.
fresh," While the plot sounds like an old familiar tune (dissipated artist changes his wicked ways when he realizes that love of family/friends is worth more than fame/fortune), it's Danny's dazzle that intoxicates."
fresh," I don't know how a film this entertaining and expertly-made can show up the last week of summer, but I'm not complaining."
rotten," Whether or not Betty sustains her character, the movie fails to maintain its own. The scenario falls apart."
rotten," Not as good as the original ... and that one kinda stunk, too!"
fresh, It feels like a variation on the last series rather than any sort of proper reinvention.
fresh," Overall, wry observation and pathos take precedence over crowd-pleasing slapstick, although some dreary pop songs prove a drag."
fresh," Two out of four is not a bad average, particularly when the half in question aren't pestiferous enough to warrant a ruckus. Fans of this sort of thing won't go hungry. "
fresh," ... in the hands of indie director Taika Waititi, who made his bones on the HBO comedy ""Flight of the Conchords,"" this is a Marvel movie as intent on busting our guts for two hours as it is on blowing stuff up."
rotten," Director Biyi Bandele adapted the book, which was superb and gut-wrenching, but the film turns turgid and shies away from showing the true horrors of the war and is the poorer for it."
rotten, A movie that probably sounded interesting at the concept stage but ends up being irretrievably outlandish in its execution.
rotten," A serviceable comedy about women who want to 'have it all,' 'I Don't Know How She Does It' takes a look at a working mother who faces the challenge of balancing her career and her family."
rotten, Henry James's complicated and courageous novel has been distilled down to a screed about the dangers and consequences of bad parenting.
rotten," A slight, sleep-inducing ""comedy"" that plods so deliberately from gag to alleged gag that nothing comes as a surprise."
rotten," One day, it may become a bad movie/cult classic -- the kind of film that people go to laugh at, like Showgirls. But for now, it's so boring it feels endless."
fresh," In the midst of blockbuster season, any viewer hungry for character-driven drama will appreciate the subtlety, intelligence and power of Into the Forest."
rotten," When in doubt, the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack, throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip. Or else a doggie winks."
rotten, Combustible chemistry is squandered for stale and cliché plot developments.
fresh," Dark, haunting and poetic"
rotten," Director Justin Kelly clearly presents the facts of the story, but the necessary psychological content is lacking."
rotten," The film, which runs a scant 83 minutes (and that includes the opening and closing credits), feels like it's just getting going when it abruptly ends."
rotten," Even worse than 2007's all-animated TMNT, putting this century one crappy Ninja Turtles-related movie ahead of the last one."
fresh," A rare film about the disabled that shows them as the regular folks they are, and the disciplined creativity of which they're capable."
rotten," The Place Beyond the Pines wants to be a deep-dish meditation on fathers, sons, and the consequences of the decisions we make. But it's a slow-burner that burns so slowly its wick completely fizzles out."
fresh," ""The Counselor"" is bleak, bleak, bleak for mainstream studio cinema, but does that really matter when a motion picture is as exquisitely helmed and stirringly envisioned as this one?"
rotten, It's hard to isolate what one is rooting for here since you know the outcome even as the opening scenes take place.
fresh," Building to a powerful conclusion, this is a documentary with real force, a compelling personal story and a dizzying visual experience that you won't easily forget."
rotten," Unashamedly romantic, it is perhaps a little too convoluted to appeal to the most devoted audience for unashamed romance, the teenage girl."
rotten," Just when it appears this can't get any worse, along comes white supremacist Donald Trump in a pointless cameo."
rotten," Payne has assembled a collection of brilliant elements here, but not all of them belong in the same movie."
rotten," The title says it all about this retro formulaic romantic comedy, and unfortunately Zellweger and Connick are not Hepburn and Tracy or Diane Keaton and Sam Shepard (Baby Boom) for that matter."
fresh," A remarkably assured, charismatic, distinct and refreshingly unabridged romantic drama about two gay men finding love at the unlikeliest of times."
fresh," For a comic book movie you hope for a few things. You hope it's well balanced, with good action, and maybe makes you want to see it at least a second time. Black Panther supersedes all that, and delivers perhaps the best superhero film of the decade."
rotten," I guess the 'real' part is that the heroine here isn't a simp as she was in, say, Cinderella, and the handsome prince is no longer that handsome and no longer behaves in a princely manner."
rotten, This is Wild Wild West meets Avengers bad.
rotten," Watchably silly at best, it's the political thriller as an unintentional comedy of errors - 24 meets Noises Off."
fresh," Not a heartbreaking work of staggering genius, but a gently uplifting film that celebrates fresh starts and life's possibilities."
fresh," Fiennes, giving one of his finest screen performances ever, beautifully illustrates every step of Justin's journey... a fine thriller (and) a genuine heartbreaker as well."
fresh," There is a lot to be admired about Wedges' Epic, as an action packed adventure movie that does little to offend and will certainly find an audience amongst the younger crowd."
rotten," Sudeikis' smooth charisma and Brie's wide-eyed charm almost carry the film, but while Headland bravely chooses to skip certain expected rom-com beats, she also fails to earn certain rom-com payoffs."
rotten, This one won't make your head swivel.
fresh," It nearly overwhelms its own inherent magical wonders and characters with an emphasis on action, but the movie also manages to work its way out from under the heavy hallowed aura that partially smothered the fun of its predecessor."
fresh," Zathura could have used that Tim Burton touch, but it's still an imaginative way for kids to kill an afternoon."
fresh," A lean and mean thriller that works more often than not, but nonetheless falls victim to its own conceit."
rotten," An animated adventure that boasts the visual prowess of the best mainstream releases in the medium, yet the storytelling sensibility of a stoner nodding furiously mid toke at the Zeitgeist documentary playing on the TV."
rotten," ""Girl Most Likely"" is a strange movie, in that it has the atmosphere of a comedy and some extreme characters set up to be comical, but there are really no funny scenes."
rotten," It's unfortunate, then, that this earnest, hard-working adaptation of the 2006 Michelle Wildgen novel... isn't a more satisfying dramatic portrayal of the disease and its impact."
rotten," Like too many video game movies it comes across like a facsimile of a facsimile, a blurry reenactment of a knockoff."
fresh," Murphy gives his most appealing performance to date, using his smug, self-satisfied, sly smile as a joke on his own well-known screen persona."
rotten, Brimming with good ideas but fails to exorcise the demons of audience pandering.
rotten," As the director, [Denzel] Washington brings no special stylistic flourish to the film, instead placing himself at the straightforward service of the Oprah Winfrey-produced story."
rotten," It's enjoyable the way Matthew Ross's screenplay and direction try to denaturalize ordinary American life as it's lived in the suburbs, but nothing everyone hasn't thought a million times before."
fresh," The Talented Mr. Ripley inhabits a world of shiny, sparkly surfaces. Looking beneath those surfaces provides provocative fun and probing drama."
rotten, This putatively tense crime story melts before our eyes.
fresh," Though the film is being widely compared to Brokeback Mountain, writer/director Francis Lee actually creates a far more believable and sympathetic scenario. "
fresh," The Waldheim Waltz is, obviously, brutally relevant not only for its native Austria...but also for all world leaders who have the ghastly ability to somehow survive the fiercest and most upright scrutiny."
rotten," Fontaine has trouble balancing the complexities. Both women express a world of conflicting emotions in their gazes, but the younger men seem lost in their roles."
fresh, This is a funny and immensely thought-provoking documentary that is a testament to just how far a pair of enthusiastic young filmmakers can go with pluck and gall.
fresh, Clever and quasi-intelligent...given the fairy tale premise.
fresh, [Corporate] is an extremely interesting film that takes a close look at a rotten system. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten," The action is fine. The casting is a bit of a disappointment. Paul Chambers, CNN."
fresh, Gripping anorexia docu; watch with your kids.
rotten," ""The Darkest Minds"" plays like a Saturday morning kids' show, complete with TV-level production values, shoddy special effects and Mandy Moore (NBC's 'This Is Us')."
fresh, Sexy and emotional.
rotten," Those with the patience to wait out Mr. Campos's overindulgences will definitely leave Afterschool unnerved, which is probably exactly what he had in mind."
rotten," [Charlie Kaufman's] follow-up to [Being John Malkovich] is just weird, although it certainly does have its moments."
fresh," Rise of the Silver Surfer doesn't aspire to much. It just happens to have the three things it needs -- velocity, artistry and a pretty good story."
rotten," Watching the same origins, the same conflicts, the same struggles, you could describe it as more, but you also call it the same."
rotten, You can't be both political and incoherent.
rotten, A San Francisco-set fantasy in which [Blake Lively] plays out a Benjamin Button-like existence through some truly awkward romantic situations.
fresh," DRIB is just trying too hard to be too many things, never managing to do any of them all that well."
fresh, All the little blue-collar Bosses and Bossettes out there in Jungleland will lap up this lively low-budget love letter.
fresh," It dragged me, kicking and screaming, back to high school."
rotten," Well acted, and occasionally droll, this is an abstract piece of work that doesn't quite excavate enough character interest to compensate for the lack of narrative."
rotten," It is mostly just an excuse for the debut director, S Craig Zahler, to whip the rug out from under you, Tarantino-style."
fresh," It's baffling and goofy, blood-soaked and not boring. That it's well-made adds to the confusion; it feels like a better film than it turns out to be."
fresh, [VIDEO] There's nothing flashy about David Gelb's serviceable rendering of a man who has achieved an unrivaled mastery of a cuisine he helped invent. You too might come away from the movie dreaming of Jiro Ono's sushi.
fresh," The movie is at its best when it's immersing you in a series of conundrums and letting you feel what it's like to live with them, and wrestle with them."
fresh," Unusually and admirably for a professional funnyman, McKay ends his film not with a punchline, but with a punch to the gut."
rotten," Its pedigree may seem like a trump card, but make no mistake -- Runner Runner is bluffing."
rotten, A miscalculation of feminine power so extreme that our country's threat level should immediately be raised.
rotten, The Civil War was about the South not wanting to give up its slaves. Now it won't give up its drugs. 'Rednecks and drugs: one of the worst hookups of the '60s.'
fresh," Ms. Sellam, cheerful and garrulous, eagerly gives accounts of both her biography and her surroundings."
rotten," There is no life and no urgency to the film. It ultimately feels static and stale. This is bitterly disappointing considering the subject matter is such a crucial, radical and urgent moment in British history."
rotten," Like a skill player who just can't score, The Damned United is all dazzle and no finish and, ultimately, damned frustrating."
fresh, It's the perfect mating of two of the screen's best 'bad boys.'
rotten, It's all so cliched in terms of personalities and full of such unbelievable situations that it's often downright laughable. And not in a good way.
fresh, Zemekis is especially skilled at the alchemy between digital entertainment and creating a portrait of a man struggling with his demons. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten, The inertia arrives very early and settles in for good.
fresh," For such a small film, The Visit represents a big win for M. Night Shyamalan."
fresh," Seriously, it is nuts the way these kids dance."
rotten, [T.J.] Miller's the find. He's out of this movie's league.
rotten," ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" has been designed as a punishment. It succeeds all too well."
fresh, Cantet is singularly skilled at evoking the universal condition of such tragic ordinariness.
fresh," For anyone who can appreciate the darker side of fairy-tales told in a musical with depth and nuance, Into the Woods is a journey worth taking."
fresh," ""The original Slumdog Millionaire""... Salaam Bombay! doesn't sweeten its depiction of poverty with feelgood fantasy, but Nair does nevertheless convey the energy and vitality that here co-exists with extreme deprivation."
rotten," It has that same kind of hit-and-miss comedy about it, and Allen is really just going through the motions at this point, just as Groucho often was."
rotten, Michael Chiklis won't have to put on that uncomfortable Thing outfit again.
fresh," Colin Firth excels as England's shy, repressed, stammering monarch, George VI (aka ""Bertie""), in a performance that's deftly matched, syllable for syllable, by Geoffrey Rush."
fresh," Ready Player One is a nostalgic trip back to all things 80's and like the Oasis, the film gives the audience a chance to escape reality for a few hours."
fresh," An actor who doesn't seem to act as much as produce sexy moments for himself to inhabit on-screen, Cruise's performance value is a function of the larger brand - sort of like Donald Trump, only with better hair, makeup and writers ..."
fresh," With catchy songs and fun moments, the film is enjoyable, although the length does get a little tedious toward the end."
rotten, The downside is that for the final half-hour the camera shakes so badly I started suffering from motion sickness.
fresh," Byrne has made his version of Our Town for the 1980s, a glorification of commonplace--and kitch--and the resilient, inventive spirit of ordinary Americans wherever they are."
fresh," The Little Stranger is a subtle, delicately unfolding film that pulls you along and gently poses many questions. It's a beautiful film and Gleeson and Wilson are splendid."
fresh," For such a violent movie, it pulls its punches a little at the last. But not before it has given us a bleak picture of the defeated misery of a certain kind of violent man, locked in a prison of his own making."
fresh, There are many things to recommend Catharine Corsini's erotically charged drama.
fresh, The writing and the actors alone provide a happy and satisfying emotional connection. 
rotten," ""The D Train"" may be a scant and rather unconvincing comedy, but it deserves credit for taking a risk."
fresh," Stoic, simmering and almost film noir, The Good Shepherd creates a very dangerous and intriguing world"
fresh," The blend of animation and live action feels natural and even at its most ridiculous points, the film is still irresistibly likeable. It may not look like much at first but Peter Rabbit is an unexpected pleasure."
rotten, Turns out people can get really irritable after seeing heaven.
fresh, Any issues with the material are made irrelevant by Denzel Washington's volcanic energy and fierce conviction.
rotten, Many moviegoers might feel betrayed by a concept that isn't nearly as funny as its predecessors in part because it doesn't try to be as funny.
fresh," A magical combination of love, loneliness, humor, and conflict."
fresh," As funny as Virgin is, it could have had more depth and meaning. Comedy can do that, and when it does, something special is achieved."
rotten," It's the bulk of the story that ultimately confuses LaGravenese, who's unable to isolate ideal dramatic highs and lows, catching the adaptation blues as he strives to please fans and welcome newcomers."
rotten," Here are two full hours of origin, with all the dull exposition and half-baked dialogue that implies."
rotten, If only writer Stacey Menear and director William Brent Bell took the very real horrors of domestic abuse as seriously as they do the virtual horror of paranormal activity.
fresh," Much more than a remake, an outstanding film that surpasses its predecessor. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten," Even when Keaton is transforming his character's stock issues into ones that feel unique and genuine, he's undercut by his director's flashiness, right up to an on-the-nose finale."
rotten," Instead of meticulously matching clues to revelations, it turns Hercule Poirot, Agatha Christie's famous detective, into an unappealingly emotional Holmes."
rotten," The problem with an action hero who banks largely on the extent to which he thinks things are boring is that, after a certain point, the audience will agree."
rotten, Yet another comic-book adaptation that should have stayed on the page...aims to be loopy and cool but only succeeds at being dumb and boring.
fresh, A defining rites-of-passage classic film.
rotten," Working with the fact-based eponymous novel by Robert Kaplow, first-time screenwriters Holly Gent Palmo and Vince Palmo are content to follow the contours of a standard behind-the-scenes story about the staging of a play."
fresh," Ha-has and emotional heft, hand in hand. And, for the most part, Apatow's approach pays dividends."
fresh, A poignant tale of undying love!
rotten," The reason why [The Lookout] took so long to get produced is readily apparent: The people in this movie may be entertaining, morally complicated, even fascinating -- but persuasive they just aren't."
fresh, An engaging popcorn movie in a summer that's littered with duds.
fresh, Offers a thoughtful reading on adolescence pushed to the edge.
fresh," Isn't about anything more than the spy game and how to make it to the end of the board...Then, too, there is Theron, whose kind of un-performance in repose keeps breaking out into ferocious fighting that suggests a feral Jackie Chan."
rotten," Krystal deserves more than a better man, she deserves to be in a stronger effort more willing to give her some characterization"
fresh," Merchant has created quite a wonderful film that I'm excited for WWE fans to see, as well as those who have never watched a single wrestling event in their life."
rotten," Without a clear-cut plot to lead him, first-time director Noam Murro gets muddled in the perpetual sadness of too many characters."
rotten," What's especially lamentable is that this movie strands yet another exemplary turn by Edward Norton, who once again is superior to the material surrounding him."
rotten," Cinderella is a story that really demands nuance in 2015, and that feature is sadly lacking in this adaptation."
rotten," ""Margaret"" was filmed in 2005 and has reportedly been delayed because of persistent editing problems. These do not seem to have been solved."
fresh," A bold, brazen movie that could only have been made because a top-notch talent decided to show off for a little bit."
rotten," The story feels like a rehash of movies we've seen, such as Stand and Deliver, Dangerous Minds and Take the Lead. If Swank's character weren't so saintly, the story might be more convincing."
rotten," What do you call a character study with shallow, sketchily-drawn characters, but a gorgeous setting? A scenery study, perhaps. Or an atmosphere study."
rotten, Reservation Road is one of those movies where the characters suffer early and often.
fresh," Just beneath the surface, Atlantis brims with adult possibility."
fresh, Your Name exploits anime's limitless potential to tell a poignant love story that incorporates gender identity and cosmic wormholes to dazzling narrative effect.
fresh," It looks amazing, the acting performances are perfect, the story is engaging, and its themes and tone combine to create a rewarding movie about an iconic Australian character."
fresh," Amini demonstrates considerable skill both with actors and with the camera, giving the film a pungent balance of visual elegance and moral seediness."
rotten," For a film about the author of one of literature's rowdiest and most mischievous protagonists (Peter Pan) it's far too bland, slow, and mopey."
rotten," That sputtering noise you hear in the nobly intentioned, intermittently moving Short Term 12 is the sound of feminism backfiring as it meets screenplay formulas."
rotten," Hancock tries to be several things at once, but fails to be anything at all! I was hoping that this was going to be a fun take on the superhero genre, but instead it's easily the worst film of the summer!!!"
fresh, Its blend of speed and music makes 'Baby Driver' one of the year's best films.
fresh," It's a mesmerising, achingly well-made film that pulses with desperation. And it's hauntingly timely."
rotten," Isn't a well-built movie, but it's by far the least repellent feature he's put together, dialing down the screaming and seething long enough to reveal sensitivity about the icon that's actually quite pleasant. "
fresh," If there is a major flaw in the film it is the direction of Alan Taylor, who honed his craft on many HBO series over the years."
fresh," Stranger danger than fiction, I Love You Phillip Morris has all the makings to be one of the year's most successful, certainly enjoyable, films. "
fresh," It's a teen thriller, practically aimed at that audience, but includes fights... bullying and, yes, a romantic story. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh," An intoxicating and quietly horrific look at one of the most public tragedies of the 20th century, that overcomes the flaws in the screenplay due to strong performances and direction."
fresh," Maybe it is just easier to laugh at things that happened decades ago, but the contemporary story never attains the same power as the flashbacks."
fresh, it's been a decade or more since Burton seems to have had a subject that engaged him on a personal level to nearly [this] degree.
fresh, Laugh-out-loud movie moments are hard to come by. Seth MacFarlane's crudely funny Ted provides several.
rotten," This is a star-studded cast, but they're only here in name only."
rotten," slick, Joel Silver-produced action movie with a borderline straight to video feel."
fresh," Watching love build; slowly, elegantly, wordlessly; between Ashima and Ashoke is spellbinding, while the complex societal pangs assaulting Gogol are palpable and real no mater what a person's skin color or cultural background."
fresh," Wickedly funny, jarringly transgressive, obdurately unpigeonholeable and startlingly moving."
fresh, It is great to see Cage go from comedy to sentimentality to drama.
fresh, It's a solid documentary but shies away from the more tabloid-ready aspects of his life. 
fresh," Snow Angels will please steadfast [David Gordon] Green fans, even if its star power makes it seem as if he's been inching toward the mainstream all along."
rotten," Creepy, pulpy and shamelessly derivative sci-fi."
rotten, Suffers from a fatal emotional and erotic imbalance.
rotten, Butler's performance-or lack thereof-keeps Hunter Killer from breaking any ground in the field of war movies.
rotten," When Ted isn't funny, it isn't much of anything. It's the sip of water a stand-up comedian takes between jokes, leaving the audience to twiddle their thumbs as they wait for the next one."
fresh," A story that begins with an interesting proposition but that, if we consider its ambitions (aesthetic, plot, even marketing) is a few steps behind. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten, Iron Man 3 is a primer on how not to handle a superhero sequel--but Paltrow's abs look great!
rotten," It's hard to imagine just who would want to sit through this movie, given the sadistic mayhem the audience is subjected to."
fresh," Like everything this star-director has done, the film is deceptively smart. It's just a little too late to the game."

fresh, 'The Intern' is more than the sitcom it appears to be from the trailers.
fresh," A disaster like no other, Glitter has as its jaw-dropping highlight what I have to believe is the only scene of seduction by vibraphone ever filmed."
fresh," Quietly moving in the way it reflects a country in crisis, where outsiders are unwelcome and easily exploited and class is no protection against the chill winds of austerity."
rotten, Girl In Progress does have potential but unfortunately it gives into the stereotypes of many female Spanish characters.
rotten," The Coens are like party acquaintances who keep changing the subject and then staring at you quizzically when you can't follow the thread, or when you stop wanting to follow it, but who then block all your exit routes from their obnoxious conversation."
fresh," Like life, it's a film full of unanswered questions and uncertain motivations."
rotten," Isn't quite a success, although the cast does put forward their best effort."
fresh, Coogler [...]has created an epic story of loyalty and destiny that somehow also feels intimate.
fresh, The busy hotel thus becomes a window that opens to the world through its narrative polyphonies... [Full review in Spanish]
fresh," This is Verhoeven's point: the violence Michèle suffers is not isolated, but just an extreme symptom of the misogyny that permeates Michèle's life."
fresh," Like an unexpected Christmas gift, this animated frature is an unexpected delight, revolving around a premise that often concerns children."
fresh," While it isn't quite the groundbreaking genre triumph many initially made it out to be, it is still a whole lot of fun. Barrett and Wingard are clever filmmakers, but unlike many modern day horror directors, their cleverness never gets in the way. "
fresh," A hugely engaging, disgressively structured piece that combines a cosmic sense of landscape with intimate character drama..."
fresh," Would be perfect if not for that damned annoying ""Mango Tree"" song."
fresh," Opera fans will find much to enjoy in this doc, which runs to almost two hours and features several long stretches of the soprano performing onstage. "
rotten, The movie doesn't dig into Scudder's character until the final act...
fresh, Blame crackles with fires within fires.
rotten," The movie is good-natured, but almost infallibly unfunny."
fresh," You would be perfectly at liberty to find it boring and empty, but also to understand the tiny resonances that have made it one of the best reviewed films of 2006 in America. Somehow it does strike home."
rotten, Feels like an elongated episode of a series rather than a standalone movie.
rotten," This Robin Hood looks like a lot of other things audiences might half-recognize, but it barely resembles the classic story on which it's based."
fresh," The Lincoln Lawyer has very little soul to speak of, but it's got swagger to burn."
rotten," So The Ivory Game is often pushily compelling. If it settled down and trusted viewers, it would stand as a stronger documentary. But this is more a work of activism than journalism."
fresh, A misguided but visually entrancing film that works better as satire.
fresh, The creepiest and most original horror film since John Carpenter's classic Halloween.
rotten," For casual fans of writer-director Kevin Smith, his new film, Clerks II, feels a little like the new Pirates of the Caribbean -- a similar wet fizzle of a sequel for sequel's sake -- but what do we know?"
fresh, In memory of beloved horror-booster Roger Ebert I'm gonna give it one hideously mangled tongues-up.
fresh," I would be lying if I said that Boogie Nights is anything but a perfect movie; at the very least, it is a film that delivers everything I am looking for in a film."
fresh," Bright, funny and charming without being cloying."
fresh," The film attains an operatic grandeur in its closing moments, and surprisingly earns it: Chandor's intensely physical, experiential work has brought us right up to the perilous edge between life and death."
fresh," The rare coming-of-age film that avoids cliches, refuses to engage in stereotypes, and wins over both your intellect and your heart."
fresh," Gorging all at once on this chocolate box of a picture feels almost greedy, but why stop at once? A large chunk of its audience will be straight back in line for seconds."
fresh," The adoption of 19th-century-melodrama conventions seems motivated mainly by a desire to tap into the emotional intensity they offer. I was enthralled by these tactics, but some viewers might gag."
fresh, Its moral is just as relevant today as it ever was during the resistance years -- that the only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.
fresh," I Origins is bigger, bolder, and altogether more intellectually ambitious than Cahill's debut."
fresh, It's surprising how well the film works as pure entertainment.
fresh, It may do nothing more than leave you choking back the laughs for fear of acknowledging the power of your inner 12-year-old.
fresh," Nearly every shot here is a visual symphony, all milky sunbeams shot through Spanish moss and white muslin flickering in candlelight."
fresh, Marvel is getting increasingly good at delivering great movies based on material that shouldn't really work on film.
fresh," ...as if they took the adage that the 'sequel is never quite as good' as permission, rather than a challenge."
fresh," Pass the bong, dude."
rotten," In the end, all the creaky floorboards and crackly old-vinyl recordings of 1940s ballads in the world, can't obscure the fact that the most haunting things about ""Marrowbone"" are the ghosts of all the better movies it fleetingly resembles."
rotten," In the bigger is better world of Hollywood sequels, How to Train Your Dragon 2 comes up short. It lacks the novelty of the original and tries too hard to be ""about"" something more than fun."
rotten, The problem with folks who throw their weight behind raunchy comedies is that they want to bankroll a state of mind. It becomes more about being bold just for the heck of it.
fresh," Sublime, with a touch of the ridiculous."
rotten," Predictable adventure has lots of violence, decent actors."
fresh," Fun and funny, if not especially deep, Baby Driver is a movie and music lover's ultimate love letter to movies and music."
fresh," Even if you have no special interest in Baker's music, he's a compelling and witty subject."
rotten, The film has some memorable moments but overall comes across surprisingly flat.
rotten, The negatives in this film far outweigh any of the positives.
rotten," There are giggles a plenty to be had, but I suspect they'd be more enjoyable on the couch with some beers and friends where yelling stuff at the screen is encouraged. Bait 3D lacks bite."
fresh," Rock is quite inventive, jumping back and forth, in and out of conversations, to create a stream of consciousness feel without tying the story in knots."
rotten," Attractively mounted and boasting some nice performances, but also peddling a thunderously stupid conceit whose dodgy details ask viewers to ignore all they know of basic human psychology."
fresh," This is high-style filmmaking wrapped up in a tormented hero whose soaring flights of greatness are matched by the mortal pull of his devils,..."
rotten, Seldom has a bio's style clashed so deafeningly with its content.
fresh, Delivers EXACTLY what it promises. Perfectly. Beautifully. Magically.
rotten, A meandering study of photographic ability with occasional inspections of obsessions and ego. 
rotten," This isn't as good as CLOVERFIELD, but it does a pretty decent job at generating some thrills. Unfortunately, the movie is ruined by Carpenter's distractingly awful performance."
fresh, It's fun for nearly half the flight.
fresh, Among the best war movies ever made.
rotten," It's the kind of movie I don't so much hate as find not worthy of even discussing, Solondz quickly becoming a misery-selling afterthought I no longer want to give the time of day."
fresh," It's all very complicated. And, thanks to the depth of feeling the three principal actors bring to their performances, undeniably powerful."
fresh," The real charm, if you will, comes to the high-octane action in the racing segments. And it is here that the film is quite simply awesome."
fresh," Harry, it's not anger or Voldemort. It's testosterone. "
rotten," This is the type of comedy where the flop sweat is nearly always present as each player tries to lift the comedy, only to tragically belly-flop over and over."
fresh," Neither among the best nor the worst of the lot, it falls somewhere inconspicuously in between, serving up both lively and ill-fitting performances as well as lush backdrops and the requisite derring-do."
rotten, Can a film being released in 2001 really expect to be taken seriously when its killer wears a mask?
fresh," As long as McG keeps the action moving, the film remains on solid ground, matching and often surpassing the thoroughly adequate 2003 entry Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines."
rotten, That the film climaxes with an inexplicable change of heart for a major character (or was it a reveal? It's impossible to tell for sure) suggests that Eggers may have taken from one too many sources to patch this thing together.
rotten, This film made me feel like a Christmas goose being fattened for slaughter. Its force-fed diet of whimsy cloyed long before the eagerly anticipated romantic payoff arrived to put me out of my misery.
rotten," It could have worked, had it ever snapped to life, but it doesn't. It just goes on and on and on and on and on and on. And on. You may even shake your watch to check it is still going. I know I did."
fresh, ...never less than utterly arresting.
rotten," A headache-inducing film that grows more obnoxious as it plays, but the most piercing element of the movie is Foster."
rotten," There's an ugly veneer of imperialism driving the film, not because it is deliberately disrespectful to its Indian characters, but because it treats them as little more than props. "
rotten, James Franco's now tiresome androgyny (so soon?) asks for wink-nod approval of Ginsberg's hero status without adequately delineating Ginsberg's personality or the emotional tensions of the late-'50s era.
fresh," fun in a free-form, slapstick, throw-away manner that is largely lacking from most high-concept Disney animated films"
fresh," in this story of pernicious, all-consuming loss, the name [Shelley] furnishes a key, pregnant with possibilities, for interpreting the film's fertile nexus of frictions and associations. "
fresh," The Dark Knight packs in at least two films worth of action, suspense, spectacle, horror, and nuanced social commentary. You'll want to see it more than twice."
rotten," February is when studios release movies that never lived up to their high hopes, and it's easy to see why with this one."
rotten," This is more the fault of the lacklustre script than the actors, who do what they can with a story that never quite gets out of first gear."
rotten," Incoherent and faltering, filled with profanity, over-the-top violence and gratuitous sadism...."
fresh," A dark and thoroughly depraved odyssey of sexual desire that strongly plays to Kim's preoccupation towards unusual, psychosexually informed chamber pieces."
fresh, As expected from the [BBC's] wildlife team the photography is top-notch with clever use of framing and film speeds capturing some amazing imagery...
fresh, Informative and occasionally scary.
rotten," Here on Earth hungers for the nostalgia of an Elia Kazan-style farmbelt romantic tragedy à la East of Eden, but the end result is more akin to a soggy Troy Donahue-Sandra Dee weeper."
fresh," It's a stale set up and no new comedy bounds are broken, but the The Week Of delivers the laughs and will surprise audiences with its genuinely sweet and heartwarming story."
fresh," Kaurismaki presents the facts of Makeba's life in straightforward manner. As a result, his politics don't get in the way of his subject's."
rotten," Aside from a toned-down finale that thankfully doesn't attempt to re-create the exhausting multiple climaxes of the original's Central Park finale, The Smurfs 2 is as bald a retread as the unimaginative title might suggest."
rotten, Often looks and sounds fabulous but is frequently devoid of any kind of clear meaning.
rotten," The ideas evaporate and the gun violence, ultimately, is all that remains. Which, perhaps, is deliberate, and very American, but deadening all the same. "
rotten, A slog of old-fashioned ideals and utter non-whimsy.
rotten," a slight genre exercise built on a spare, straight-to-video backbone and fleshed out with Soderbergh's experimental attitude"
rotten, Fast Food Nation works far better as journalism than as drama.
rotten," After 'Red Riding Hood,' Hardwicke might have a tough time holding onto whatever clout she has left. Who'd have thought going to grandma's could be such a nightmare?"
rotten, Too shapeless and unplotted; and Mangan's not-too-ruffled rueful affability hails more from sitcom land.
fresh, The Mars Generation doesn't seem to be a documentary for established space lovers but for people who are marginally interested in science.
fresh," The nose itself is a perfect prop for a man who began his career with a fake arrow through his head, a man who has since evolved from a coolly absurdist stand-up comic to a fully formed, amazingly nimble comic actor."
fresh, It's a rarity for a movie to be willing to try your patience like The Sixth Sense does and even more of one for your perseverance to be so amply rewarded.
rotten," Raising Helen is competent, commercial, square-as-square-can-be popular entertainment."
rotten, The film's only trump cards are its actors. You have to give credit to Saif Ali Khan and Radhika Apte for playing such hollow and badly written roles with such conviction. 
fresh," Everything about The Wolfpack is extraordinary, beginning with the subjects of Crystal Moselle's mesmerizing documentary."
rotten, Parental Content Review
fresh," Gleefully entertaining from start to finish, the kind of film that'll quickly put a grin on your face that won't subside until long after the credits roll."
fresh," Miller crafts a warmly, but not entirely optimistic fable about the salutary power of lazy afternoons, meals taken at dusk beneath outdoor tents and, ultimately, of moviemaking itself."
rotten," This incarnation of The Thing is much like the creature it depicts: An insidious, defective mimic of the real, er, thing. It's not an entirely lost cause, but it is a needless one. "
fresh, [It's] a story about the elusive nature of evil in a world that thinks information ... will eventually solve our problems.
rotten, There's some stunning cinematography courtesy frequent collaborator Thierry Arbogast. But the narrative is weak and the film is weighted down by conceptual overindulgence.
rotten," By the time Bay and Bruckheimer appropriate John F. Kennedy's image in their final small-town-America montage, it's clear their pomposity knows no limits."
rotten," Someday Hollywood will think of women as more than fallopian tubes in heels; until then, we're stuck with this kind of project."
fresh," While the film initially requires a modicum of patience as it finds its footing, those who persevere will be rewarded with plenty of chills, thrills and an utterly twisted climax that cements The Canal's status as a memorable yarn."
fresh," Keeps you guessing throughout, a very well written piece and yet another Oscar contender."
rotten," Like many a grifter, this crime caper is all style and no substance."
rotten," Of all of the projects for Spike Lee to attach his name onto, Love and Basketball may go down as one of the most idiotic."
rotten," The movie is less ho-ho-ho than uh-oh, or oh-no."
fresh," It's an extraordinary method of making this unfathomable act personal, a formalist experiment that yields stunning emotional dividends."
rotten," Despite visual nods to dozens of classic Westerns, the film cannot break through with its own vision."
rotten, A few shots of full frontal and an actual devil to point to are poor substitutes for exposure and depth of character.
fresh," The setup is common enough, but though you can check off the usual ingredients in what follows - sex, drugs, a glance at Kurt Cobain - this is the furthest thing from a social-issue teen drama."
rotten, It was like eating celery - crunchy and loud and tasty - then zero caloric content after all that trouble chewing it.
fresh," Energetic, funny and entertaining; there's nothing stiff about Hairspray"
rotten," ""The Last Station"" is the kind of dramatically bound historic material that could soar on Broadway with the cast, but not the script, of its film version."
rotten," As problematic as the two leads are, they are inconsequential to this poorly written story"
rotten, ...ultimately devolves into just another forgettable straight-to-video horror flick that predominantly features characters hiding and running within all-too-dark environs. 
rotten," Rather than a sing-along, consider this film a 'say-along,' with lines so clichéd that you might find yourself reciting them in perfect sync with the flat characters."
rotten," Sad to say it is not even this generation's 'Short Circuit.' Families deserve much better entertainment at the movie theater, summer or otherwise."
rotten," The only sequel I'd like to see, after enduring this one, is Rugrats Get Cancelled."
rotten," This AIDS courtroom drama is so pumped full of nitrous oxide, you could get your teeth drilled on it."
fresh, It draws an impressive portrait of Thurgood Marshall as a strong and towering figure. If only it didn't do that by making everyone around him so weak and small.
fresh, Clarke will break your heart and help you recognize Daenerys Targaryen is just the beginning for a brilliant actress who's going to have a very long and distinguished career.
rotten," Once the movie shifts gears, it becomes a timid Donnie Darko-like surrealist fable."
fresh," With wit, understanding, and directorial smarts, The Diary of a Teenage Girl makes for an uncommonly loveable debut and adaptation. "
rotten," Like American filmmakers, it seems the French don't know when to quit, either."
rotten, Feels precision-engineered for a morally torn fanboy who likes the idea of female empowerment but needs it served with a heavy dose of torture porn and glistening flesh.
rotten," The House is a solid, if unremarkable, big studio comedy with fleeting moments of humor peppered throughout its runtime."
fresh," While it might not launch a Western cinematic resurgence, The Magnificent Seven gives the genre a much needed shot in the arm. Say hello to the fall's first big blockbuster."
fresh, Will make you laugh out loud more than a few times with its often juvenile and scatological humour.
rotten," Predictable romcom send-up has racy sex scenes, language."
fresh, The eye-popping design and sense of scale remains as fresh and vital as it was in 1927.
fresh," The details in Midnight Special, Nichols' homage-heavy sci-fi thriller set in his signature Deep South locale, are sometimes so scant as to be jarring. Yes, less is often more in Hollywood, but it can also be just plain less."
rotten, Plays like the cheap DisneyToons small screen cash-in effort it clearly was conceived and always meant to be.
rotten," Simpson steals the show -- which, admittedly, isn't saying much considering her stiffest competition comes by way of a skateboarding bulldog."
fresh, Pair their back and forth with a hilarious cast of periphery players and 2 Guns pretty much has everything you'd want from a summer action comedy.
rotten, CJ7 is too bizarre an amalgam of sappy sentimentality and life-on-the-streets edginess.
rotten," It's less of a labyrinth than a forest path, one that takes you through wonderful scenery but doesn't lead anywhere."
rotten," While the Scottish landscape has never looked more enticing, sadly, majestic mountains and sweeping seascapes cannot plaster over the uncomfortable cracks in McFarlane's feature debut. "
fresh, Antonio Campos's character study of a prep school social misfit named Robert (Ezra Miller) is an intimate psychological journey into a coded juvenile mindset.
fresh," Again favoring tension over bedlam, Wan issues a similar but successful follow-up to Insidious, finding proper beats of fright and family to play in this throwback endeavor. "
rotten," One of the worst, most disheartening times I have had in a movie theater. (Full Content Review for Parents - Sex, Nudity, Violence, Profanity, etc. - Also Available)"
fresh," If watching a Nazi's head explode after a grenade is stuffed in his mouth isn't worth the price of admission, well, then you and I just have very different ideas about what a good time at the movies is worth."
rotten, The original Halloween is so embedded in the horror-movie consciousness now that you can't not know what happens here.
rotten," The Huntsman: Winter's War having so many good bits made me me more frustrated than if it had been a wall-to-wall mediocre movie. Because there is potential, and it was squandered. "
rotten," If this is a sign of things to come, the ""Dark Universe"" should be buried and left to rot beside ""Dracula Untold."""
fresh," If you're looking for outright scares, you might be disappointed; for a slasher, Happy Death Day is also very light on bloodshed. But it's got real heart - for a film about death, it's surprisingly life-affirming."
rotten, In their determination to resuscitate the musical they've managed only to bury it deeper.
rotten," No matter how good all this looks, there's not enough tension to keep us on our toes and not enough depth of character to make us care how it all plays out."
rotten, How could these two guys NOT be funny? See the movie and find out.
fresh, This isn't just a haunted house story; it's more elemental than that.
fresh," Ultimately Secret is a bit like going into a dark dungeon where the air is heavy, the mood oppressive and you're not quite sure what's going to jump out. But you must make the descent."
fresh," Unlike anything else you've seen, and very much worth seeking out, this is a unique and beautiful creation."
fresh, The combined verve Diaz and Kutcher bring to the table saves a routine time-killer from being entirely forgettable.
fresh," These are people you know, maybe people like you."
fresh," If it weren't for the Greengrass/Ackroyd school of eye-crossing filmmaking, it would be even more intense and gripping, but this filmmaking duo prefer to use a hand held camera in all circumstances "
fresh," I checked my brain out, and gasp, got some entertainment value from the film. The special effects, fight choreography, and production design are actually pretty good."
rotten," The film is tasked with cramming an entire life into the minimum of time, and it often comes up short when it comes to canny explorations and richer examinations of both Joplin's individual life and her greater legacy. "
fresh, A light-hearted but enjoyable remake thanks largely to Russell Brand's charismatic and larger-than-life onscreen persona.
rotten, Messy and inconclusive as a mystery thriller.
rotten, A 14th-century road movie with 21st-century cuss words.
fresh," Though Rabbit Hole tells a familiar tale, its goofy, loving feel for human cruelty and rage, for kindness and breakthrough bursts of exuberance, lifts this lovely chamber piece high above the crowd."
fresh," Dynamite ticking-bomb-thriller follow-up to the smash Da Vinci Code, about a cataclysmic device set to destroy the Vatican, will most certainly have explosive results at the box office."
rotten," Don't cop to what others think you should be. Stay true to your inner light. Be yourself, la la la!"
rotten," There's little here to convince the audience of boy and girl's special chemistry, and nothing to attach the audience to them, either."
fresh," While Stewart and McKellen don't have much to do this time, their younger selves McAvoy and Fassbender deliver commendable performances."
fresh," Fassbinder's historicism is a crucial aspect of his modernism: he didn't just make use of prior forms, he quoted them, and derived from them the ironies implicit in his melodramatic styles."
fresh," Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World is endearingly relatable precisely because it celebrates the ordinary, focusing far more on the foibles and frailties of the players than on the invincible avatars of a game."
fresh," Caressing and coaxing its way under your skin, Guiraudie's latest is an amorous, raw and chillingly seductive psychological thriller full of razor-sharp suspense and an abundance of stylish eroticism."
rotten," Even with Martin Sheen's impressive Chris Cringle facial hair, The Vessel annoys and irritates more than anything else. The film may be alluring to look at, but it's absolutely torturous to endure and practically unbearable to watch."
rotten, Nolan's sense of memory and of history is as flattened-out and untroubled as his sense of psychology and of character.
rotten, ...an aggressively pointless and utterly forgettable misfire from filmmaker Scott.
fresh," A stop-gap tale that's modest, fun and briefly amusing rather than one that breaks new ground or offers hugely memorable set pieces."
rotten," It's not a good film, but viewed from a cockeyed angle, it's a great guilty pleasure, and director Bill Condon is in on the joke."
rotten," If someone came to me very specifically seeking a movie with a 'tag' themed title that'll make them laugh... well, no, I'd still recommend 'It' first."
rotten, A righteous exercise. It just could be a better righteous exercise.
fresh," Disney, please understand ... what people are actually showing up for ... they just want to see classic Disney on the big screen. The 3D is incidental."
fresh, Lowe might want to evolve away from violent dark comedy in future projects. But this one is gruesomely successful.
fresh," It probably had extravaganza status in mind at the outset, but it may have to settle with fun fantasy curiosity."
fresh, This impressive children's adventure strikes a balance between magical adventure and heartfelt emotion that the wizard from Hogwarts has yet to discover.
fresh, Part of what makes this Brazilian coming-of-age drama so winning is the way it declines to make a big deal out of what is arguably a big deal.
rotten," Pacific Rim simply had more personality whereas Uprising delivers the same style of excitement, but filtered through a more generic Hollywood lens"
fresh, Perhaps [author Ransom Riggs'] imagination has helped awaken Burton's lethargic creative magic. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh, Sometimes all we really want from a movie is to spend some time with beloved actors. [Blu-ray]
fresh, Indignation is exquisitely crafted and beautifully acted.
fresh," It's simple: If you're a fan of the franchise, you will like the movie."
fresh," Argento works so hard for his effects -- throwing around shock cuts, colored lights, and peculiar camera angles -- that it would be impolite not to be a little frightened."
fresh," Comfortable with tackling both the comedy of clumsiness and heavier sequences of despair, Steinfeld handles the tricky breakdown of Nadine's sham persona - the real existential crisis she is going through - with real generosity and humour."
rotten," The Life Aquatic is Anderson's least interesting film, and should serve as a demonstration of the vapidity of his so-called brilliance."
rotten, The story is a lurching carnival of budget blasts.
fresh, What really makes Almost Famous almost great is McDormand's brilliance as the mother only some of us get: a woman who prepares her child for an extraordinary life.
rotten, I really don't know what this movie is trying to say. 
rotten," It's a very naughty tome, with many dangling bits."
fresh," You'll probably come to Idlewild for the musical excitement, but you may just find yourself leaving with a surprisingly bittersweet lump in your throat."
fresh, It doesn't hurt that director Roger Michell has peppered the cast with above-average actors...that seemingly inhabit their roles with ease.
rotten," Bhoomi is a revenge drama that tries a lot to be bold, brave and advocate feminism but wants to stay in the comfort zone of a typical Bollywood masala film. The result is stereotypes, over-the-top melodrama and a predictable story."
rotten, ...we are expected to suspend our disbelief and accept that the adorable Kristen Bell needs some sort of crackpot magic spell to attract suitors.
rotten, A sputtering remake in need of a more powerful recharge.
rotten," We've heard those trumpet riffs before; we watched Rocky do push-ups to them. And that's all ""The Cutting Edge"" is -- ""Rocky"" on skates."
fresh, A skyscraper caper that gives an occasional humorous nod to its craziness without being too knowing; this is a straight-up blockbuster to enjoy without having to feel clever at the same time. (I felt many things watching it but clever wasn't one of them.)
rotten," The problem is presenting the follies of Wall Street as an ordinary crime, the fault of one specific villain who just acted incorrectly. Catch that one guy, and I guess everything is just fine."
fresh," No band epitomized smart punk rock more than the Minutemen, and no band's legacy better captures the sense of tragedy that underlies the history of punk."
rotten, Gangs didn't really live up to the hype.
fresh," 'Terminator Genisys' is not remotely on par with the greatness of the first two, but is a definite improvement over the last installment."
fresh, Inventive crime thriller full of personal touches and a gripping story.
rotten," While the script provides ample illustrations of Wallace's tough life, there is not enough focus on what set the recording star apart from his peers or why he became so incredibly popular so quickly."
fresh," Cameron's eye-popping visuals are the story, particularly because the actual narrative is too simple to sustain the 150-minute run time."
fresh, I watched this film horrified and fascinated. There is such raw pain here.
fresh," Perfunctorily assembled, Pandora's Promise is essentially a pamphlet in motion whose goal is to prompt a larger discussion. But it offers plenty to discuss, and that isn't bad."
rotten, That's why God invented the dog days of August -- for dogs like this.
fresh, Mystic River is refreshingly adult; Eastwood doesn't pander to a younger crowd
fresh, ... the Susanne Bartsch legacy endures just as brightly as it began.
fresh," Founded on solidly serious themes of ageing, dying, illness and crime, the film does not on the surface offer much hope for fun, but the surface is exactly where the fun is"
rotten," ""The Prime Ministers: The Pioneers"" takes on a vast subject - the history of the modern state of Israel - from a disappointingly narrow perspective."
rotten," Watching R.I.P.D., the unfamiliar viewer is given the distinct impression that this movie is probably an entertaining graphic novel -- but it's a terrible film."
rotten," Cassavettes wants this to be a love letter to Rowlands, his mother. She is luminous, and we believe she could inspire great love. Too bad it's not in a great movie. "
fresh," With or without the crazy, single-shot experiment, the German drama is thrilling."
rotten," The combination of relentless forward drive and gruesomely fastidious detail, while audacious and admirable in theory, begins to pay dwindling returns in a picture that feels rather longer than its 122-minute running time."
fresh," Rarely has a book sprung so vividly to life, but also worked so enthrallingly in pure movie terms."
fresh, A world-class winner [about] a perpetual dreamer stepping up to the plate in a poignant grand slam story of ambitions lost & gained among ethnic outcasts of 1956 Staten Island
rotten, Double Jeoprady has all the legal savvy of the O.J. Simpson jury.
fresh," For all its goofiness and silliness, the story bops amiably and fluently along. It's a sort of boxset drama where the best stuff is in the last episode."
rotten," ""Backtrace"" is a bore before it becomes a mess."
fresh," [A] socially conscious, supremely accomplished procedural thriller."
fresh," Anchored by a charming performance from Greta Gerwig, it's as light and breezy as a walk in Central Park, and just as refreshing."
fresh, A movie that aches with bereavement.
rotten," By thrusting the story about women who pass themselves off as men in nineteenth-century England into close-up, this film version accentuates its implausibility to fatal effect. "
rotten," Someone call Geneva. Torture has a new name, and it's called Nine. For there are few more agonising experiences this holiday season than squirming through the painfully misfired ambitions of this star-studded Rob Marshall musical."
fresh," If you don't find yourself happily swept up by this slim yet immensely charming adaptation, maybe you're not the movie fanatic you thought you were."
fresh, At least there's a joke about how Amanda Seyfried looks a bit like Gollum. Take your victories and all that.
fresh, An incidental thread that serves as an excuse for the director to capture on screen an amalgam of memories and a veritable whirlwind of sensations on the surface. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten, Salivating gore with classic title.
fresh, Captain America: Civil War is one of the best superhero movies out there because it dares to break the formula. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh, Arnold vividly captures the cocky ignorance and exuberant recklessness of kids who were never taught any better.
fresh," Danner is probably the main reason to see the movie, and her screen presence is impressive; she's an actor who manages to bring gravitas to any role, and that includes her work in goofy things like Ben Stiller's Meet the Parents series."
rotten, The Red Baron is impressively shot and has some great dogfight sequences but it's badly let down by a dull script and fails to engage on an emotional level.
fresh, This film isn't for everyone. But those who can stomach it will find it a chilling glimpse into a serious psychological disorder.
fresh," Brokeback Mountain coaxes audiences to walk several hundred miles in its characters' shoes, luring us with the scent of forbidden fruit and rewarding us with the sumptuous taste of complex storytelling."
fresh," The story is predictable, but it is much better that the sleep-inducing first movie... But go watch it as a standalone film, and you will be fine. "
fresh," Brick is as difficult to categorize as its hard-boiled, made-up lingo is hard to understand -- neither of which should deter anyone from seeing it. It's rare to see a debut as witty and assured as this."
fresh," This movie is bathed in bright hues with a sweaty haze; it feels lush, almost overripe."
rotten," Beneath that patina of penis jokes and four-letter words beats a weak and sentimental heart that fails to deliver the film's promise of raucous fun, instead wasting a talented cast of comediennes on cliche platitudes on motherhood."
rotten," Mel Gibson returns to the 40's with this movie to make Christian propaganda, and to the 80's to film an excessive violence that disguises of honor. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten," once she lets her love depraved leads meet, [Denis'] story becomes a hopeless, unsatisfying muddle"
fresh," Rent is still Rent, and devotees should adore it while haters will hate it (there are, apparently, plenty of both)."
rotten, My recommendation? Skip this movie and buy the soundtrack instead.
fresh, Dead Awake is a dream come true for fans of modern horror with a classic look and feel.
fresh, I was at the point of Enough J-Lo until I saw this flick
fresh," Wonky pacing and superfluous dramatic moments aside, the WrestleMania-sized tantalizing prospect of Jason Statham taking on a massive shark delivers in gloriously stupid fun"
rotten," Biopic about Argentinian music icon has sex, drugs, cursing. "
rotten," Terrible, just terrible."
fresh," For 100 minutes, I didn't think about anything else at all. And sometimes that small relief is the best thing a movie can give."
fresh," This is an utterly adorable, endearing and wonderful all-ages feature that's as much a love letter to the hand-drawn art form as it is to comedy in general."
rotten," The jokes are dumb, the story is nonsensical and no one seems particularly thrilled to be there, but it's still an improvement from the last one. "
fresh," Apocalypse Road is considerably better put together than it easily could have been, and given a flick of style courtesy of a mesmerising synth score. "
fresh," If this bright and nimble French comedy about a romantic mercenary hired to break up an engaged couple can't break the stunningly talented Romain Duris as a star in America, it's hard to see what could."
rotten, The Host just isn't a very good movie. 
rotten," Q-bert terrified out of his mind, watches a child play The Last of Us, as Adam Sandler quips ""is this the most violent game you have ever seen"". Of course, the writers then ruin that goodwill built up by having him piss blocks"
rotten, The film's biggest problem is its inability to lend its clichés and tropes any dramatic thrust or satirical bite.
fresh, An unexpected delight for all the family.
rotten," Even surrounded by unbearable sloppiness, Leguizamo is fascinating to watch."
rotten," Ultimately, it's a marketing pitch in search of a movie that proves punishingly flat, with even the slapstick so sparsely delivered as to replicate a long slog through the zoo, surrounded by fidgety kids, on a suffocating summer's day."
rotten," Aside from the rage of being tricked into forking over extra cash for a third dimension that practically doesn't even exist, it isn't all that bad."
rotten," [A] juvenile and, apparently, intentionally crappy final outing that has nothing insightful to add to an already overstretched idea."
rotten," I guess the 'real' part is that the heroine here isn't a simp as she was in, say, Cinderella, and the handsome prince is no longer that handsome and no longer behaves in a princely manner."
fresh," Like many South Korean films, revenge is a major theme here, although the way Kim handles it is particularly subtle and surprising: It sneaks up on you. "
rotten," Clooney's film telegraphs everything with a beacon, eschews basic logic and didn't elicit a single smile, let alone laugh. The best that can be said about ""Suburbicon"" is that it sports some cool vintage wallpaper."
rotten, The human interaction is just a little too precious and the digression away from the dogs and the main story is just too long for it to feel like anything but a major detour.
rotten," There's real joy in these [magic] moments, and you pine for more of them as the film wears on and Dillard baits-and-switches us, focusing more and more on the monotonous good-kid-gets-in-too-deep-with-bad-guys story."
fresh," It's about hype and, although it was made decades before the word was coined, it still has eye-opening things to convey about the slippery business of celebrity journalism. Such is the value of first-hand experience."
fresh," You probably don't need to have seen the previous five movies to follow this one; the story (by director Paul W.S. Anderson, who is also Mr. Jovovich) is as violently incomprehensible as the others, anyway."
rotten," Hard as it tries to be harmless feel-good fodder, its notion that one character's Asperger's can be cured by a hearty sing-song makes it a more offensive musical than Team America ever dared."
fresh," But if viewers put politics aside, imagining everyone on screen as a character rather than a stand-in for a real-life figure, they will find Game Change offers enough Shakespearean machinations to warrant praise as an exceptional melodrama."
fresh," Steven Soderbergh's best film since Sex, Lies and Videotape a decade ago."
fresh," As always, (Bennett) Miller exhibits observant, masterful control as director and coaxes excellent work from his great cast. But I found the screenplay problematic in terms of failing to provide much psychological insight."
rotten, Simply too much unpleasantness afoot.
fresh," I want to persuade you to see Baghead, but I don't want to overhype it, because in many ways it's a delicate construction best served as a surprise."
fresh," It's funny, non-stop inventive and heroically heretical."
fresh, Barney's Version is worth seeing for Giamatti's boisterous yet nuanced portrayal and the energetic but wry performance from Hoffman.
rotten, You know you're in trouble when the most appealing parts of a cartoon are the landscapes.
rotten," Wouldn't be Perry if the film wasn't outrageously irrational, flimsily edited, acted with rafter-quaking severity, and scripted with Magic Markers. I'd feel cheated at this point if he actually made a concentrated effort to maintain a steady dramatic tone"
fresh," The real radiance in this sumptuous, likable fantasy-fulfillment comedy comes from Queen Latifah."
rotten, Neither the sci-fi nor the comedy are strong enough to sustain the movie.
rotten," The wan drama is enlivened by bursts of black comedy, some bits more effective than others, and though it ultimately disappoints, there's promise in the understated creepiness of Riley Stearns' debut feature."
rotten, ...mind-numbingly moronic despite good 3D and CGI...
rotten, A high-budget spectacle of garish overkill.
rotten," Tropic Thunder gives us exactly what we expect of it - lashings of easy fun, spare-no-expense action, actors delightedly pushing the boat out in all-out parody and a dig at the absurdity of Hollywood that the big boys back in LA will find quite comforting"
rotten," There's so much terminal cuteness in the picture, I wanted to walk away after the first twenty minutes. Nevertheless, I stayed the course."
rotten," While Solondz tries and tries hard, Storytelling fails to provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket."
fresh, A perfectly splendid evocation not only of the late 1970s but of a lost slice of American childhood...
fresh, While Owens left Berlin with four gold medals - and a deserving place as one of the greatest athletes of the early 20th century - the film at best settles for the bronze.
rotten, You wish you could fast-forward through all the unnecessary talking stuff and get to the battles. 
fresh," Though straining credibility, this movie testifies once again to Robin Williams's ability to play serious roles."
fresh, There's a melancholic sweetness to it which will stay with you more resonantly than its gentle humour.
rotten," Marking time until Roos gets tired of spinning his webs of astringent, pithy, smug little nothings."
rotten, Despite being factual strains credibility.
fresh," A stellar documentary highly suggested for horror buffs, film lovers, and aspiring filmmakers alike."
rotten," This time, the con is on the audience."
fresh," While Alejandro Guzman Alvarez's Mexican indie ""Walking Distance"" moves as slowly as its corpulent hero, it's mostly gentle and sweet, if you can forgive its somewhat unsatisfactory third act."
fresh," Poots is lively and likeable, Aniston and Ifans are both very funny and it's lovely to see the great Cybill Shepherd -- who got her big break in The Last Picture Show -- doing her loyal bit as Izzy's mum."
fresh," With a crew like this, you can welcome the future."
fresh, It takes a little while to warm up but Barney's Version is a charming film that will leave you reflecting on your own life.
fresh, Costner takes over a Jack Nicholson part and perfectly engages us. Not every middle-aged star needs Tarantino to have a career resurrected. 
fresh, Half Nelson is far from pleasant. But life isn't always pleasant and there's definitely room for movies that reflect that.
fresh," Fans of risky, avant-garde independent fare with biting humor and unsettling insight will remember this audacious oddity for a long, long time."
rotten," A romantic drama complicated by a stroller and a wheelchair, and its first mistake is in assuming some kind of equity between the two vehicles. "
rotten, Grossing out your audience isn't going to solve your problems and make your film work.
rotten," This sequel ends up feeling a bit like cinematic road kill, neither exciting nor comic enough to get anyone's motor running."
rotten," The film sleepwalks along confidently enough in its numb, semi-unfunny, semi-unserious way. But the tale's passion and subversion have been removed."
rotten, Looks like we have to add John Waters to the list of filmmakers who have run out of things to say.
fresh, A true pleasure. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten, I'm not really sure who would enjoy this movie. It's a little too rich for most people's digestions.
fresh, Touch of Evil is one of Orson Welles's greatest achievements on film. 
fresh," The Rider is Jandreau's story to tell, and he relives every moment of this terrible time in his life with an unbelievable stoicism and psychological depth."
rotten," While the film's premise is shamelessly hokey and Joe Nussbaum's direction is at best pedestrian, props are due the young cast, especially Bynes, whose can-do optimism seems genuine if ultimately overdone."
rotten," Francofonia is scatterbrained, occasionally leaden, frequently redundant, crammed with false starts and dead ends, wrapped in gauzy greenish murk."
rotten, Director David Frankel gives the movie the aw-shucks feeling of a sitcom with a large sentimental streak.
rotten," While nothing is more dramatic than the change at the core of this film - Katniss' move from survivor to leader - it's not enough, on its own, to comfortably sustain a two-and-a-half-hour film."
rotten, What I saw was a case of filmmakers blissed out on their own hermetic concept.
fresh, Don't worry about the convuluted plot: see it for a kickass performance by women's martial arts champ Gina Carano.
rotten," The predictability is crushing, and with movies like Crazy Heart and Sofia Coppola's distinctly personal Somewhere so close in the rearview, David M. Rosenthal's estrangement drama feels especially soft."
rotten, There's no actual humans in this. All they do is just grunt and give tough guy dialogue.
rotten, Makes the similarly themed Love Story seem positively sophisticated by comparison.
rotten," Where are the babes? The boobs? The bling? The alligators and neon? Grimly determined to rebrand his franchise and rewrite cultural history, Mann has turned Crockett and Tubbs into a solemn pair of nighthawks..."
fresh," A fascinating examination of the role of radical artist in bourgeois society that prioritizes the drama of an individual rather than the social drama of a crackdown that anticipated Pinochet. Despite that, it is great filmmaking. "
rotten," There is some clever social satire here, but only in fits and starts, and never toward a cohesive goal."
fresh," With appealing characters and a winning retro soundtrack including The Cure and Lou Reed, it's a very entertaining watch - even if it doesn't reach the cult status it seems to be striving for."
rotten, The film's annoying casual misogyny and tiresome bickering derail any consistent comic momentum toward a predictable resolution.
rotten," The Return is a slow burn that's often way too slow, feeling stretched to meet a running time that's still under 90 minutes."
fresh," As with all Pixar efforts, this is visually outstanding, and there's plenty of rowdy humor to keep audiences entertained. But for a supposedly progressive film, Brave is marked by a notable amount of timidity."
rotten," Although Mr. Edwards's last-place finishes in Calgary made him something of a sensation, a symbol of do-it-yourself persistence, this film doesn't seem to trust the inherent likability of his story."
rotten," It's just too damn amiable to be outrageous, and if it ain't outrageous, it's a swing-and-a-miss at the premise. Not good when playing in Pee Wee League."
fresh," Screenwriter Tony Gillroy (Michael Clayton) returns to his uninhabited, wounded and desperately virile characters. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh," Revitalizing the series with fresh blood and new ideas, ""X-Men: First Class"" is an altogether superior motion picturegrander, better written, and more dramatically sound."
rotten," As a space-opera lampoon, it's incoherent primarily because it's never clear what the filmmakers are attempting to spoof. "
rotten, UNCLE DREW is far from a slam dunk.
rotten," As more ethical lines are crossed, and the felonies being committed during the ruse multiply, ""Overboard"" seems more twisted than funny."
rotten," Though supposedly on the same side, Bennett and Lona will stop at nothing to one-up each other until ... well, what do you reckon?"
fresh," Approaches proceedings in a naturalistic manner, lending what could have been a stuffy costume drama an immediacy and edge..."
fresh, [A] smart and even funny story of a young woman nearing the bottom of her anorexia.
rotten," This one has all the right ingredients to be a great Bond flick, I mean Christopher Lee is the main villain! I don't exactly know how they screwed this up, but they did. "
fresh," The weight of graphic, grotesque violence hangs over the entire movie. But the daring emotional violence lingers longer, well after the lights go down on the final shot."
fresh, An unavoidable shortcoming of the documentary is the absence of Beaton's peers. Somewhat making up for that is an even more dazzling lineup of period film clips and vintage photographs.
fresh," Cooper manages to show that he is still capable of doing more than his traditional throw-away, comedic roles."
fresh," Chuck & Buck is a dark misfit of a movie that's sweet, scary, thought-provoking and off-putting all in one package. It's a bold, original achievement."
rotten, Zack Snyder finally hits rock bottom with this absolutely interminable trainwreck of a blockbuster...
rotten," The weakest of the three films and should really only appeal to diehard fans of the franchise. The film is billed as ""the end,"" and it's a relief that this hangover has finally subsided."
fresh," The story is more convoluted than the previous installments and it runs a bit slow in the middle, but it remains entertaining."
rotten," In yet the umpteenth arrested development manchild comedy, Rainn Wilson lets his inner Jack Black out with a good dose of Will Ferrell style body barement and mines some laughs out of a largely forgettable film."
fresh," The BFG isn't a remake of E.T. or A.I. but its own peculiar epic. It's an involuted fairy tale, leaning both Left and Right, expressing the quiddities of utopian imagination. Spielberg's childlike optimism brings quixotic ideas to life."
fresh, A film that may become a little preachy but nonetheless asserts itself as an important document for the world's attention.
rotten," [The] latest, dreadful entry in the vampires-battling-werewolves franchise."
fresh, [It] brings this dangerous numbers game back to the trading-floor desktops and mahogany-covered conference tables where it belongs.
fresh, The thinness of the plot -- as opposed to the sturdy themes -- and sitcom-y snap of the dialogue only tire towards the end.
rotten," It would have worked better if it weren't so obvious and manipulative. About halfway through, it plays more like a diagram of lessons learned than a movie about real people dealing with complicated problems."
fresh, A predictable plot with trademark David Cronenberg highlights is salvaged by a great cast... but just barely.
fresh," All of these personal touches add whimsy to an otherwise familiar John Hughes-esque formula, full of awkward comic relief sidekicks, experimentations with drugs, romantic misunderstandings and a cool, often retro soundtrack."
fresh, Avengers: Infinity War succeeds in eliciting the emotional responses that Marvel has worked on building up over the last ten years.
rotten," Directed by Fred Durst (of the band ""Limp Bizkit""), ""The Longshots"" is a cookie-cutter feel-good kid's movie that seems like it was made by some faulty gadget stuck on auto-pilot."
rotten," A lazy, vulgar and painfully idiotic buddy-cop comedy that is as generic and predictable as they come."
fresh, Uses imagination and exciting locations to give the movie the same kind of pulp adventure feeling we get from the Indiana Jones movies.
rotten," Eastwood can't overcome the inherent problem that everyday Joes like split-second heroes Spencer Stone, Alek Skarlatos and Anthony Sadler don't necessarily have cinematic back-stories."
fresh, A beautiful and indelible work of film. A relentless cinematic allegory. The work of a visionary. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh," It makes you laugh, it could very well make you cry, and the animation is just magnificent. It could be the most well-rounded film that Disney has ever made."
fresh, A brilliant noir pastiche with Jeff Bridges and Cynthia Erivo the perfect pair to give it some emotional heft. 
rotten, Howard tries desperately to balance the comedy against the screenplay's tense domestic melodrama ... and mostly fails. 
rotten," Directed by Simon West, who made the infinitely superior Con Air, it teeters under the weight of its clichés."
rotten," An apologia for the critical errors made by Mary Mapes, an award-winning producer for CBS News and 60 Minutes, and her team of investigators."
rotten," When you want to put down Sky Mall for a few minutes, Inferno will be right there, on the back of the seat in front of you."
rotten," Offers a labored treatise on the Japanese national character, with endless speeches about honor, devotion, loyalty, and the people's reverence for their emperor as a human deity."
fresh," Gilroy is a master at laying out a twisty plot, and Anderson directs with the kind of verve that enables almost all the twists to hit us with the force of surprise."
fresh," Director Richard Linklater's life-affirming Before trilogy is the Lord of the Rings of the art-house experience, the Toy Story of the American indie movement."
rotten," Don't believe the hype. This is one bad ""'Driver."""
fresh," It records the ingenuity, daring and innovation that went into his productions and drove him to create his own studio and distribution company and to take his career into his own hands."
fresh," Sam Levinson has a good eye for adolescent rebellion, and combined with the demented violence, this study of New Age depravity could become a classic midnight movie."
fresh," Rare is the flick that wedges this many genres into one frame, and so well."
fresh," Scott's wait-what's-that-shiny-thing-over-there directing style can be annoying in a movie that has actual characters, like ""Man on Fire."" But ""Unstoppable"" isn't about the people; it's about averting a disaster..."
fresh, I was locked in from the beginning. They got me into the world...really good movie.
rotten," A sharper movie would have nailed these peripheral details, but they're handled with lazy, ""Sandlerian"" indifference."
rotten," If you have ever seen a movie produced between 1983 and 1991, you know exactly what happens."
rotten," In its dystopia which some viewers may consider a utopia, atmosphere and dread reign, too little is explained, and the coldness of story makes for aloof cinema."
rotten," After this promising start, the movie itself suddenly downturns and plummets to its own death."
rotten," These are fine methods for delivering a civics lesson, which to some extent is what the Attenborough approach is all about. But for a film that aspires to entertain as well as educate, they are less helpful."
fresh," You'd go mad unpicking the paradoxes in this convoluted brain scrambler. (If you thought Schwentke's Flightplan was bonkers, try this one on for size.) Better to surrender to its implausibilities and revel in the lush, sudsy silliness of it all."
rotten," Psychologically, there's perhaps something in the situation that's worth exploring, but director Händl Klaus so attenuates the already thin plot material that after a while it's hard to care about these guys."
fresh, An involving look into the relationship between a major actress and her status-climbing assistant.
fresh, A gripping if occasionally overwrought drama radiated by a standout turn from Seydoux.
rotten, The storytelling feels mechanical and contrived.
fresh," Even for those who don't regard the notion of perfect objectivity with the wariness it deserves, there are compensatory insights in this movie's unapologetic fascination with its subject."
fresh, Dynamic storytelling and powerful performances bring out the pathos in an unusual tale of conflicting loyalties set on the criminal edges of a travelling community.
fresh," Fury Road is a two-hour car chase, but strapped to the hood (much like Max himself in the early scenes) is a simple, satisfying story."
rotten," One way to break down cultural walls is assimilation, and that's where Ping Pong Playa has its dubious triumph: it's just about as generic as the next 'loser makes good by coaching kids' comedy...[Blu-ray]"
rotten," What's wrong with the new Ben-Hur? How long have you got? This is a textbook case, step by agonising step, of how not to make a big-budget blockbuster."
fresh," The film sags a little in its final third, and all the white-on-white interiors get a bit wearing for the eyes; but this chip off the old block has a strong talent behind it and much to recommend it."
fresh," Scorsese's best film since Casino, his most provocative since Goodfellas and by far the funniest film he's ever made."
fresh," Filled with music from many genres, from folk to jazz to rock and roll, Pawel Pawlikowski's Cold War is a sumptuous, sad, and often thrilling story of love set mostly in post-war Poland."
rotten," Once the gimmickry is exhausted - and a few of the jokes repeated - you'll be wondering why a movie titled ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" isn't funnier, wittier, more glibly satirical."
rotten," Despite its talent, 'Broken City' is an unremarkable film. Soon enough, most everyone will forget about it. It's not 'Chinatown.'"
fresh," The cast is overflowing with talent, and every actor gets at least one moment in the spotlight. "
fresh," A must-see, no matter how many times you've seen it."
fresh," Marvelous. It's impossible to shake the feeling that we are merely eavesdropping on reality. Witty, wise, and -- most important of all -- truly romantic in ways that movies usually aren't."
rotten, Decidedly out of date.
fresh," Disobedience contrasts sharply with A Fantastic Woman for its refusal to offer up heroes to cheer for and villains to hate. There are only decisions, repercussions and the pull of tradition that makes freedom traumatic."
rotten," Despite frequent declarations of his fixation with Salome, Pacino as both helmer and star fails to make clear the source of this obsession."
fresh," In spite of the acting horrors who are Christensen and Portman, the ""Star Wars"" series manages to go out on a high note."
rotten, Disappointing because it could have been so much more.
fresh," Laughton, as he managed to do in Devil and the Deep and The Sign of the Cross, gives the role of the villain a peculiarly horrifying quality by humanizing it far beyond the demands of the script."
fresh, After a slow start the movie gets better and better as it goes along
fresh, An envelope-pushing melodrama just this side of 'Pulp Fiction' parody.
rotten," Whereas the first two succeeded in explicitly condemning society's lust for carnage, Election Year opts to revel in it. It's a disturbing development in the series, especially given the times we live in."
rotten," Mortimer is wasted, Bill Nighy dreadful and Patricia Clarkson all at sea. "
rotten," A robotic exercise in moviemaking that will no doubt satisfy the requirements of millions of distracted moviegoers who no longer require absolute engagement to be entertained-and who might, in fact, prefer exactly that."
rotten," The whole story is nothing more than an elaborate MacGuffin. In the end, it's not important."
rotten, Free Fire is a blend of thriller and black comedy that doesn't work as either.
fresh," Even with its flaws, the film is a worthy tribute and a reminder that the fight continues and the march goes on, built on the backs and sacrifices of people like Marsha P. Johnson."
fresh, Reacher fans will probably be happy enough with this debut outing for their hulking hero.
fresh, If you like Scott you can argue that too much is better than too little. This movie has a vision and sticks to it.
rotten," [K]eeps running right up to moments that seem hellbent on, say, indulging homophobia... and then stopping short, neglecting to offer a punchline, and trying to distract us by moving in an entirely random different direction..."
rotten, The biggest (only?) pleasure of The Last Knight is watching the film struggle with its identity and slowly become aware of its own awfulness.
fresh, Who knew that the franchise's creators would eventually find a plot twist that made sense?
fresh," Add it all up, including the nifty twist at the end, and what we have here is a fun Hollywood flick with a good head on its shoulders."
rotten," God or Jack Valenti only knows how this work of pure entertainment got an R rating 'for strong grisly violence and gore, sequences of terror and torture, nudity and language.'"
rotten, The intriguing but uninspired Solace can't escape the clutches of '90s serial-killer thriller déjà vu. 
fresh, The ABCs of Death is a repulsive and excessive excuse of blood-soaked entertainment that should make the horror fan in you squeal with delight.
rotten," Too often, diarrhea-into-a-hat feels like a metaphor for what MacFarlane's doing with the movie."
fresh," This is Chandor's triumph, and marks him out as someone to keep an eye on in the future."
rotten," Coming in just under the wire for consideration as the worst movie of the year, this big-budget Netflix original [is] a mess of apocalyptic proportions, a black hole of a movie that sucks all life from the screen."
fresh," Not without problems, but continues the Avengers tradition of big, bold blockbusters that don't need to toss away thoughtfulness to remain pure popcorn fun."
fresh," Uno de los escritos más sagrados del cine (el cual con el tiempo ha adquirido validez) indica que una secuela no puede superar a la original. Y aunque la vara estaba alta, Bird ni se acerca a lo que había logrado hace catorce años."
rotten, Gilliam's paean to the imagination seems to lack imagination.
fresh," A piercing, immersive, and superbly played convent drama in which the suppression of speech is witnessed at both an individual and institutional level."
fresh," The landscape plays a major role... with its bleak, open spaces, adding to the feeling that the characters and their emotions are curiously incidental."
fresh, Karl Marx City is that rarest of objects: an exploration of family history that avoids solipsism and manages to connect the personal to much broader things. 
fresh," Almost annually since his breakout hit, Taken, in 2008, Neeson has come out with a terrific thriller and this one does not disappoint, highlighted by high tension and outstanding gritty cinematography of Brooklyn. "
rotten," Although there are some fun jolts and gruesome shocks to be had, Friend Request struggles to find anything new to say, feeling instead like something you'd half-remembered from a decade ago."
fresh," Even when the acting is hammy, notably Wilford Brimley's turn as Chance's Cajun uncle, Woo stages every fight with hypnotic grace."
fresh, its unadorned sense of realism sets Wings apart from so many special-effects-laden action movies today that exchange pixels for stuntmen and computer logarithms for physical reality
fresh," Powerful, gorgeous."
fresh," Despite the title you may find it considerably tamer than a great many nature documentaries, but it's a solid, respectable introduction to the South African preserves."
fresh," [A] briskly paced, deliciously entertaining, and thoughtfully respectful look at the life of somebody who all too easily could have been consigned to a life in the history books and little more."
rotten, The mirthless atmosphere and laid-back narrative strip Crowe and his aquatic drama of any fun it could have had.
rotten," Becomes slightly more bearable when it tries to be serious after failing so badly to be hip and funny, but embedded within the later dramatic scenes are desperately dumb plot decisions that lead us to a calamitous ending."
rotten," It takes roughly five minutes before the first fart joke arrives in ""The Road Chip,"" with the production wasting little time before they reach for desperation."
fresh," The camera loves Offerman's expressive eyes and Sam's beautiful, determined face. This is a coming-of-age film for dads as much as it is for daughters."
rotten, It's a mighty awkward adaptation for such an uncomplicated project...
rotten," Perfectly positioned to take advantage of the health care debate. Unfortunately, the satire doesn't get any more complex than 'What if the mortgage crisis were over livers instead of houses?'"
fresh, Their Finest is so skilfully constructed that you may not even notice it's a perfect replication of the genre it salutes.
rotten," All this couldn't be further in spirit from the source material, where part of the point is that the ""real"" Tony remains a mystery, even or especially to himself."
rotten, Insurgent is often more exciting and more eye-catching than its predecessor. Too bad its characters aren't any more interesting.
rotten," Written and directed by Max Mayer, this anodyne romantic comedy is as predictable as the alphabet but should hold particular appeal to women whose maternal impulses inflect their mating instincts."
fresh," Enjoyable, fast paced, blackly comic and occasionally horror-tinged thriller with a sharp script, impressive direction and a terrific central performance from Aksel Hennie."
rotten," The first film's director Tim Story's also on board, but there's nothing much he can do with this material."
rotten, Quite possibly the most revolting studio picture since the execrable 1980 Al Pacino flick Cruising
fresh, Elegantly expresses a tender and heartfelt message about the undying love of family. 
fresh," In coming up with one of the finest modern fantasies to date, del Toro seamlessly blends two stories, one set in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War and the other in a parallel realm of fairies and fauns."
fresh," This film turns its satire on the loveable serial killing rogue archetype, something that it seems some genre fans find harder to swallow."
rotten," Fatally, the director never spends time on any of the characters who fill the screen -- and while no sensible person goes to a monster movie for deep human drama, you need at least a sprinkling to make it work."
fresh," By the time McKay's finished connecting the dots, we begin to see Cheney as the epicenter of an earth-shaking collapse of government norms so destructive you keep asking yourself, ""Why am I laughing?"" "
rotten," Getaway has some of the crass trappings of a charmingly crass, go-for-broke action pic like the delightful Crank. But it's too dumb - and far too cynical about what audiences want - to even know how to have fun with them."
fresh," A fun, effects-filled, escapist adventure, with several clever notions: Medusa sells garden statuary as a cover, and the Parthenon in Nashville is home to a hydra."
fresh," A fascinatingly disturbing true-crime documentary, Tales of the Grim Sleeper isn't just about a serial killer, but a film about race and class and the value -- or lack of it -- that society places on certain women."
rotten," I certainly didn't hate what's presented, and J-Lo is as watchable as always. But I couldn't escape the feeling that I had seen everything before, and more than once. (Full Content Review for Parents - Profanity, etc. - also Available)"
rotten," The perfect movie to see if you do not enjoy being surprised, challenged, or inspired. "
fresh," The new Ghostbusters is a fresh take on the franchise, with four strong leads and an interesting new entrypoint into the series."
fresh," Like a picture being slowly developed, the second film by Rigoberto Perezcano is a mistery that never comes to an end. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh, Good remake of the 1956 film with direction that bogs in superfluous touches.
fresh, It's a testament to the film's grasp on its subject that watching it feels like scrolling through Instagram or Twitter - an internet outrage cycle in containment.
fresh, Every generation needs a gross-out extravaganza to call its own. Is there any real point in objecting?
rotten," Rum is in short supply and a diary might have come in handy to understand who Paul Kemp is beneath the surface. That is, if the viewer had been given a reason to care in the first place."
rotten," Filho never explicitly addresses the psychology of either character, staying in observational, in-the-moment mode instead of providing any kind of emotional insight or backstory."
rotten, Arguably the horror/sci-fi director's most routine movie.
rotten," The helmer can't inject feeling into a cold-blooded creation. It's a gorgeous film; sadly, it's not a silent one. "
fresh, A surprisingly well-made mash-up of old-fashion war movie tropes and proudly disgusting horror-flick shocks. It's a ton of fun.
fresh," Screenwriter Julie Lipson's well-written, naturalistic dialogue helps pass the time, as does Michelle Lawler's lovely scenic cinematography."
rotten," As a mix tape (or ipod shuffle) of gospel music, Rejoice and Shout is a wonderful starting place"
rotten, The film gets too caught up in the semi-farcical comings and goings of the two Sophies and Ethans to explore any of the issues it raises about relationships very deeply.
rotten, Todd Haynes' Wonderstruck is a childhood fable brimming with lush visuals yet too wispy to bear them.
fresh, Howard and Morgan have transformed this story into something more than an embellished re-telling of recent history. They have shaped a tragedy that is almost Shakespearean in force
fresh, A movie with characters you like being allowed to like (despite their imperfections). 
fresh," Kate Winslet as sexy femme fatale with a wicked pair of shears is a lot of fun. As her mum ""Mad"" Molly, Judy David triumphs."
fresh," American Sniper is imperfect and at times a little corny, but also ambivalent and complicated in ways that are uniquely Eastwoodian."
rotten," To borrow the term from a friend, this latest instalment in the Hunger Games series is suffering from ""part-one-itis."""
rotten," A shapeless muddle, with a handful of good scenes adrift in a sea of general mediocrity."
rotten, MacFarlane has lost his way.
fresh," It's no Office Space, but it's amiable enough."
fresh, Geoghegan manages to craft a film that works both as a modern horror film and as a love letter to the kinds of films he grew up with. 
fresh, The Judge is packed tight; it's enlightening and suspenseful and paced for maximum enjoyment.
rotten, I don't think this is what we agreed to when we tweeted #WalrusYes. Weird is good but it should still be tonally consistent.
fresh," Utterly charming, as easy to fall in love with as the island is to Juliet."
fresh," A revolting, creepy, and enthralling metamorphosis movie that toys with the audience's ideas of horror and retribution, while presenting a stream of verbal and visual jokes with a great turn by Michael Parks. Kevin Smith is back!"
rotten, A self-aware exploitation picture that winks as it picks your pocket.
rotten," Wahlberg could sleepwalk through this role, and does. See this movie and you'll surely follow his lead."
rotten," In its quest to sidestep clichés, this low-budget mix of romance and science fiction winds up too muddled and unfocused to have much of an impact."
fresh," Craig manages to steal each scene he's in with his bleached hair, impeccable Southern accent and hair-trigger personality. An Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor is likely."
fresh," As a horror movie, Insidious: The Last Key is well-done and enjoyable. As a vehicle for an older actress, it's pretty great."
fresh," Sure. We'll stay, just a little bit longer."
rotten, Summit Entertainment has tried just a little too hard to broaden the appeal of its new computer-animated feature Astro Boy.
fresh," Batman is a stunning achievement, especially through the incredible and unique visualization of director Tim Burton."
rotten," Plays as if King took it out of the trunk, blew the dust off, and cashed his check."
fresh," Pattinson, freed from the white pancake and clunking dialogue of the undead, brings a sweet innocence to the part, one that makes the symbolism of Rosie's trunk curling up to his chin as he talks with Marlena disingenuous, almost sweet"
fresh, Creative Cold War Bond thriller is best for teens and up.
rotten," A movie about two writers, but it doesn't seem to have a clue about why writers write or about how writers write."
rotten, This material...isn't deceptively simple. It's just simple.
rotten, It's impossible to imagine a more implausible role as 'Jenny from the Block' citing Homer's Odyssey to a classroom of attentive students.
rotten, full review at Movies for the Masses
fresh, The movie is both a testament to Charlie Brown's place in pop culture and also a showcase for a new generation bound to fall in love with its perennially insecure star.
rotten, Tepid sitcom romantic-comedy that's not a bow-wow but never gets out of the doghouse.
fresh," Such as it is then, Far From the Madding Crowd, is a mixed bag, but one that's easy to recommend."
rotten, Pardon me while I yawn.
rotten," For every observantly funny line, there's a tired joke about long East Indian names; for every forward-looking musical cue, there's a strenuously unhip flashback ..."
fresh, Real classics improve with age as does E.T.
rotten," The T&A in this film is truly amazing, as if Russ Meyer served as creative consultant. I lost count of how many times an Angel shakes out her hair in slow-mo like a Keeshond wicking rainwater from its pelt."
rotten," 'I did all my own stunts,' said Kate, by which she primarily meant the one called 'acting.'"
fresh, Not only the definitive American documentary about the war in Vietnam but a landmark political action.
rotten, I thought this film is one long corny cliché.
rotten," If you want to be frightened, don't bother with this remake."
rotten, A feigned attempt at a stereotypically quirky indie film that has virtually nothing in the way of formal sophistication or narrative ambition.
fresh," One of the strengths of this film resides in the ambience, making it seem like an homage to the films rolled in the period in which it occurs. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten," No matter how hastily pieced together the film feels, you can't help but admire Ellis' tenacity... It's just a shame it's not any good."
rotten, Desert Dancer is the dramatization of a life story that rarely doesn't feel like a dramatization.
fresh," a balls-to-the-wall tank-ful of amiable idiocy, fast-paced enough to keep anyone's eye on the road."
fresh, Eighth Grade expertly captures those middle school growing pains every American kid for generations has endured.
fresh, As poignant as it is buoyant.
rotten," Dunstan mistakes unpleasantness for fear, reveling in gore for its own sake and destroying any anticipation or suspense in the bargain."
rotten, undercooked to an amateurish degree
rotten," The result is a film that has the feel of brainy, high-end science fiction, but ultimately neither the underlying structure nor content. It's a shame, given that we are in the midst of a modest heyday for the subgenre."
fresh," Saldanha and his team of crack animators paint the vibrant, verdant settings in eye-catching detail, providing ample visual distraction from the patchy plot ..."
fresh," Slicker than the original without the sudden lurches in quality, this second shaky-cam horror anthology still has a standout sequence by which all the others must be judged."
fresh, A conventional storyline buoyed by a host of exceptional performances.
fresh, Winged Migration must be the most subversive G-rated film ever.
fresh," Star-producer Warren Beatty takes a stereotypically gay character, a glamorous hairdresser, and turns it into a womanizer in Beverly Hills, which is sort of Our Town, suburbia as small-town America, only four decades later."
rotten, The new feature-length Star Wars cartoon is so cute that I want to hug it. Tightly. Until it stops breathing.
rotten, It's clear [director Gary] Ross was very sincere about not making this just another reductive prestige picture. But his ambitions got the better of him.
fresh, Enjoyable British romcom enlivened by strong performances and two stand-out scenes in particular.
fresh," While it wasn't as funny as I thought it would be, and John Cena isn't quite there yet as a leading man in a movie...it's still funny and it still delivers laughs."
fresh, The friendship between the two is astoundingly recreated.[Full Review in Spanish]
rotten," It's heartbreaking enough to witness a shallow remake of a treasured classic, but it's equally depressing to watch comedy masters Ben Stiller and the Farrelly brothers go so completely off their game."
rotten," It's so dull. While some actors have praised the movie for its accurate portrayal of backstage life, if you haven't trodden the boards it's much harder to get caught up in the A-to-B dramas facing the troupe, or Richard and Sonja's affair."
rotten, Watching a lonely suitcase circle a baggage claim conveyor belt is more diverting.
fresh," We get a sense of the sheer energy of the early days of TV news %u2013 a seat-of-the-pants excitement that, like its newspaper equivalent, has long since disappeared."
rotten, ... terror is diluted in the drama. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten," The sex, like almost everything else in The Last Mistress, is mechanical."
fresh," ...a tough watch, but it is also an incredibly impressive piece of truth-telling cinema."
fresh," Elocuente señal de alarma de lo que tenemos que brindarles a las nuevas generaciones: dirección, educación sexual y motivación"
fresh," Anderson and Wilson allow personalities to evolve, allow bad guys to get second chances, and let love find its own unique path to heal wounds and mend hearts."
fresh," This hilarious trio... have bawdy chemistry, and a kind of hanging-out comedic naturalism."
fresh," Comic-strip superhero movies are not exactly noted for intelligence, wit or humour. Iron Man 3 is the welcome exception."
rotten," To swallow Elizabethtown without experiencing a sharp tummy cramp of disbelief, you have to accept Orlando Bloom as a tormented soul."
rotten," It feels like Jumper might have been longer at one point, then had everything but the action scenes removed. What plays on the screen is therefore an empty, hollow shell of a film that keeps you at arm's length."
fresh," If you came here to laugh, [Game Night] is your option. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten," With a wimpy protagonist and a reticent director driving the story, The City of Your Final Destination doesn't go far enough."
rotten," The problem with An Unfinished Life is it tries too hard to be the equivalent of Million Dollar Baby, notwithstanding the fact that it was actually made before Clint's opus."
rotten," If you can remember the pair's MTV heyday, these attractions will seem tame."
fresh," A solid two-hander from a pair of veteran European actors, but one that plays a bit fast and loose with historical facts."
rotten, Tries to blend heartwarming moral observation with ill-fitting metaphysical contrivance.
fresh," I thoroughly enjoyed every guitar plunk, drum beat, sax squawk and even Cher quote."

rotten," Tucci takes our collective urge to excuse bad behavior in the name of art, a topic we desperately need to consider right now, but he doesn't really put it under a microscope to see why that happens or how that relationship works. "
fresh," A very original, funny and highly accurate dissection of the teen girl world."
fresh," It boasts some strong performances. Irish character actor Brendan Gleeson steals the show as the appropriately named Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Moody, and the three young leads show increasing confidence in front of the camera (especially Grint)."
fresh," Liman juggles political intrigue with low-key domestic drama to polished, largely riveting effect. Great star turns, too."
fresh," English has imbued proceedings with a gratifying brutality; a grubby, washed out, theatre of nastiness..."
rotten," Because of Winn Dixie is a touching, sincere, heart-warming family film that nonetheless made me want to bail after about 30 minutes."
fresh, Slight but intellectually entertaining.
rotten," Somewhere amidst a jumble of fast images and unscripted shouts, I couldn't help but feel that this all would have been more effective in a movie that played the material with a more straightforward approach."
rotten," It's a shame his film surrendered to its own impatience to get to the ""good stuff."" It feels like whole chunks of the movie are missing. We never even get resolutions to the corrupt construction company and possibly-murdered ex-colleague subplots!"
rotten, The screenplay is a collection of half-formed ideas andpartial character traits masquerading as fully-rounded people.
fresh," The storyline is wonderfully subversive, and the jokes come so fast and furious that it's a challenge to keep up with the humor of The Lego Movie."
fresh," Until the misguided last act, 'Insidious' manages to generate some genuine chills and a few chuckles...Unlike the best horror films, though, it probably won't stick with you long after the lights come up."
rotten," The only other good thing there is to say about Force 2 is that it is not as bad as it could have been. If that is a movie standard you can live with, have fun."
fresh," A remarkable accomplishment, an absorbing documentary about the joy of reading that's also a positively gripping literary mystery."
rotten, An uneven parody that sometimes amuses but just as often annoys.
rotten," It's an average film, packing some good Grace-Harty laughs while others gags fall off the mark."
fresh," It explores family relationships, infidelities, and internal treasons, but it never leaves political context outside. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh," There is something exquisitely personal about this documentary in which he tells his story in conversation with his friend of over 40 years, producer Andrew Braunsberg"
rotten, Much of the dialogue for this terminally mawkish tearjerker sounds as if it has been taken directly from a Dolly Parton or Whitney Houston song.
fresh," The actors didn't know exactly where the script was going, but their improvised dialogue moves authentically from teasing to discomfort to light jokes about something deeper."
fresh," This is never a great film. In scattered stretches, though, it's a very good one."
rotten," It's the freaks against the squares again, though Waters' celebration of freakishness has never looked quite so square."
fresh, The type of heavy drama that might not necessarily play for mass audiences but the skill of filmmaking and talented cast should bring the film some critical prestige.
rotten," For people who insist that the movie is never as good as the book, your case just got stronger."
fresh," It may not be perfect, but Hatchet III is still a ton of fun and McDonnell does a great job at delivering a sequel that feels much bigger and bolder than anything we've seen so far in the Hatchet series."
fresh, Producer and fellow impressionist Ridley Scott must surely be impressed with what the younger film-maker has achieved with 8.5 million
rotten," There are a surprizing number of good laughs, but in the end it's an NBC movie of the week filmed in 35mm."
fresh," Medem closes a tentative stage, in search of a reformulation of himself that he did not find, to propose the bold declaration of principles of those who are willing to go beyond the excess of Caótica Ana. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten," Even on its own limited terms, the jokes are sub-Friday sequel, and a last-act grab for Boyz n the Hood pathos is seriously reaching."
fresh, Neeson muscles Unknown to Success
fresh," A movie of dazzling, garish colors that bops to an electric New Wave beat."
rotten, An aggressively mediocre improvement on the first film.
fresh," Fueled by an ambition that channels enthusiasm for characters and narrative details above the high-octane action, and driven by visual effects that are a compliment to those traits rather than a distraction. "
fresh, The writing is brilliant; the acting is masterful; the direction is breathtaking; the costumes are beautiful; and every little detail in the film is charming and witty.
rotten," The struggles remain, but [director] Adamson has tweaked the plot, rejiggered the character dynamics and piled on the epic warfare. By the end I had overdosed on surly Peter, pouty Caspian and over-digitized shock-and-awe."
fresh," Okja moves seamlessly between fairy tale, action caper and crime drama."
rotten," In reality, this guy would be in jail stripes before you can say, ""Martha Stewart."""
rotten," Speaking lines they cannot possibly understand, not one actor makes any attempt to be believable. So manufactured and synthetic that they eventually lose all sense of reality, they're like reconstituted orange juice and processed cheese."
fresh," Ferencz... comes across as thoughtful, principled and engaging in a film that, in keeping with his demeanor, is a modest profile rather than a sprawling portrait."
rotten," Demonstrates that when filmgoers decide they want to be scared, they will forgive absolutely anything -- bad acting, cheesy dialogue, poor camerawork, bad editing, unconvincing effects, incoherent storytelling -- for the sake of a good scare."
rotten," [A Cure For Wellness] doesn't just stretch the limits of plausibility, it punches plausibility in the guts, pushes it into a river and waves goodbye."
fresh," Don't let the movie's premise turn you off to what is one of the most affirming, gratifying films you'll see this year."
fresh," Neill Blomkamp's choice to indulge in his bigger budget by throwing in every advanced technology he could conjure up dilutes the more thoughtful, raw components of the film."
fresh," With Restless, Van Sant seems to be aiming for somewhere in between the art house and the cineplex by delivering a movie that is as heartwarming as it is strange."
fresh, This tension between the various players in the art game makes The Price of Everything intriguing. 
fresh," A lightweight action-comedy that only tries to entertain, but at least it meets that modest goal. And it knocks out lighter weight comedies like The School of Rock."
rotten, Just incredibly mind-numbing and unfunny...
fresh," I just spent the whole movie covering my eyes, opening them right before what I knew was going to happen happened ... and then shutting them again and curling up. These movies, man. They get me every time."
fresh," Miyazaki's ode to motherhood; the sea is the greatest nurturer of all. The underwater sequences are some of Ghibli's most luminous, complex reflections of nature's teeming beauty."
fresh," Yes Man is a typical Carrey vehicle (schematically, it's a lot like Liar Liar), but it's better than most of them due to a top-notch supporting cast."
fresh," Action may seem slow in coming, but interest never flags and Winocour doesn't flinch from necessary violence. Hollywood awaits her, if she's interested."
fresh," The film is small, economic and - once the third act hits - actually cool."
rotten," The film promises a fabulous twist that never comes, and delivers instead some cutesy magical realist touches (lots of interior boy brain stuff) and a palpable lack of chemistry between Dornan and Gadon."
fresh, It's George Clooney's best showcase to date -- a picture that is as strong as the war itself was dubious and one-sided.
fresh," More technically adventurous than Peele's debut, showcasing encouraging cinematic development diminished by a few iffy filmmaking habits."
fresh," The film is filled with finely composed shots that show both the beauty and the ugliness of Saudi Arabia, inside and out."
fresh, Just like catching up with old friends...
fresh," That's where the film truly succeeds: Frears doesn't treat Florence like a joke, and neither does Streep."
rotten, Here's hoping Refn's next one redeems him.
rotten," Director Mark Steven Johnson is infinitely less concerned with exploring Blaze's smoldering, soul-deprived isolation than he is infatuated with the character's skull-'n'-bones imagery."
fresh," Emmerich builds his global disaster invigoratingly and the special effects team are to be commended, but the screenplay is a holey assemblage of cliche and borrowings"
fresh," Basically, if you were to make a Frankenstein's monster from the premises of Tower Heist and Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo, you'd get Step Up 4."
rotten, Opening up the couple's life and taking a more straightforward approach to the material could have made the film immensely more impactful.
fresh," There are scenes, typically the most destructive ones, that could be plopped into any old ""X-Men"" movie. But director Yates knows his way around this stuff."
rotten, It is a suspense film released by Miramax over the holiday season for maximum financial and Oscar-related benefits.
fresh," Jenkins manages to find a bleak sort of humor in all of this, but the heartache of the situation is achingly close to the surface."
rotten," Sadly, Jurassic World's magnificent dinosaurs just aren't enough to overcome the logic failings of a surprisingly recycled plot. "
fresh," More exciting than Verhoeven fans might expect, Wiseman's Total reboot won't betray your fond memories of its iconic predecessor."
fresh," Tautou's inherent charm, garnished with a gaze of innocent sexuality, lends the character of Amélie the perfect recipe for audiences to take her to their collective hearts."
fresh," It's a bumpy ride, but Due Date is a road movie trip worth taking. "
fresh," The Fly seizes on our ingrained, instinctive horror of sexuality, the sense of shame that our fundamentally puritanical society can't help but teach us, and by confirming our worst fears, helps us, for a moment, to move beyond them."
rotten," In terms of films based upon outlandish stories, I'm way more worried about how Alfonso Cuarón is going to handle the next Harry Potter movie."
fresh, Spectacular ... but it never really lifts you up into a new imaginative realm -- it never takes you away. It just keeps blazing at you. 
rotten," It's all too earnest, to the point of serving, unwittingly or otherwise, as an apologia."
rotten," Campbell just renders the comic book mythology in bright colors with expensive CGI, and then sort of shrugs - ""here you go, nerds."""
rotten, The only compelling thing about Souvenir is the the opportunity it provides to see Isabelle Huppert. 
fresh, Bolt is enormous fun from start to finish for adults and kids alike. Disney animation doesn't get much better than this - especially when in many places you will get to see this in 3D.
fresh," [PODCAST] ""Possession"" holds the watermark for the most bizarre cinematic experience you will ever have. No other film begins to approach the madness of romantic obsession and political oppression that this film does."
rotten," Home Again is a fascinating banality, the movie equivalent of a staring at a bucolic motel painting until you start to see skeletons in the haystacks."
fresh, I guarantee it will make you feel better than any other film that comes out this year.
fresh," Inception is an elegant, portentous ride, though I'm not sure Nolan is any closer to visualizing the real (dream) deal than Hitchcock was."
fresh, Considering Beatrix in her heart of hearts wanted people to just sit back and enjoy themselves while reading her books it seems to me that a film about her life doing the same would be perfectly apropos.
fresh, This is one wild film for sure and deserves all the attention it has already garnered.
rotten," While the special effects are top notch... the humans are dull, the dialogue is ridiculous, and anyone expecting a repeat of the action in 300 is going to be sorely disappointed with this bloodless PG-13 adventure."
rotten," This comedy isn't just juvenile, it's borderline brainless - the sort of bland, unfunny and, at times, slightly offensive drivel that one might expect from a grade schooler."
rotten, It doesn't offer enough fresh material either to inspire or to infuriate.
fresh," manages to stay just this side of saccharine, most of the time"
fresh," A seamless blend of humor and thoughtfulness, Farrelly's film effortlessly sweeps you along for its journey, becoming a pure pleasant-surprise crowd pleaser in the process."
fresh," If not for the expertness of [the] actors, Philomena would be a sloggy journey indeed. Fortunately, Dench and Coogan are more than capable of turning water into wine."
rotten, This film sucks on a level I can scarcely describe.
fresh," It's an exceptional piece of work, while serving as a commentary of how the fight for human rights is still very much in its infancy, and how far we still have to go."
fresh, Visually appealing.
rotten, Night School is a by-the-numbers and forgettable studio comedy that fails to realize the full potential of its promising cast and premise.
fresh," It may not be great, but it's pure, and it deserved better."
fresh," Greenaway has tempered the delight in packing his digitally modified compositions that made Prospero's Books so overwhelming, but that's not saying much."
fresh, The third in the series about the singing chipmunks and their exasperated but perpetually forgiving human father is a little brighter and sweeter than its predecessors.
fresh, An enjoyable if not especially imaginative sequel.
fresh, Rawal's well-shot film is engaging - particularly for those with an interest in running and/or meditation - but the lack of balance between each of the four stories ultimately throws the film off.
fresh," In everything from writing to humor to songs, the sequel is operating at about 75 percent capacity of the first film "
rotten," [American Assassin] plays like ""The Bourne Identity for Dummies,"" a bland wannabe with a threadbare plot that -- the ample violence notwithstanding -- mostly misses the mark."
rotten, A piece of tasty meringue to enjoy!
fresh," Despite its superhero trappings, The Dark Knight is more a piece of film noir."
rotten, Some privileged nature footage from the African rain forest is dishonored by deeply silly narration in Chimpanzee.
rotten, Youngsters should have a fine time. Adults not easily persuaded that any children's film is automatically charming might bring a book.
rotten," If I was 6, I think I'd have had a good time, but I'm not and nothing I tried could make this go by any faster - I wanted to run screaming from the theater and warn everybody."
fresh, ... Jason Bourne proves to be a worthy entry into the Bourne saga.
fresh, See this film. Pay homage to the healing truth. A landmark film; would that it could reduce the lag time between genocides and our real-time grasp of their horrifying reality.
rotten, The Clan is a shallow examination of the inescapable influence of family...
fresh, The Fits is a unique spin.
rotten," An overproduced, baffling movie that falls flat."
fresh," Miss Bala is one of the highlights of the year so far for me, a powerful experience, and Naranjo is, without a doubt, a born filmmaker."
rotten, A convoluted yet clichéd love story with some ill-executed gladiator antics and a barrage of bad CG.
fresh," A smart script makes the film good, but near perfect delivery by some of our favorite unhinged actors make it great."
fresh, A nice parable on the power of the community to face the fanaticism that will possibly piss the feminists. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh, This is a remarkably accomplished film.
rotten," Hard to believe, but Edward Norton in cornrows is one of the less ludicrous things you'll see in this film."
rotten," The filmmakers want to show us a magical world that is, at the same time, wholly believable. They want to create matter-of-fact miracles, but what they end up with is mostly just plain matter-of-fact."
fresh, Marsh takes a complicated persona and reveals a range of dimensions. The result is an engaging biopic that is often quite moving.
rotten," There's a terrific idea at the heart of Pleasantville, and it's a shame that its creator, Big screenwriter Gary Ross, can't figure where to take it."
fresh," Where Borat had unsuspecting victims, The Dictaror is stuck with actors; the Candid Camera element erased. As is the shock value."
rotten, A waste of talent.
rotten," No reason to see it. No reason not to see it, either. Shrug."
rotten, Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins reinforces the sense that movies are not about real life but about other movies.
fresh," It doesn't completely lay Bond's psychological complexities naked, cold and bare. But ""GoldenEye"" can hardly be faulted for occasional concessions to casual entertainment - especially with a superior villain, taut action and an all-time Bond girl."
rotten," A sappy geriatric comedy that starts amusingly brittle but quickly goes soft, it's a showcase for MacLaine, but not a happy one."
rotten, This vigilante potboiler jettisons any sense of realistic goodwill with viewers by detouring into a series of silly plot twists and half-cocked conspiracy theories.
fresh," At its most gently successful, the movie is a character study with intensely baroque observations."
fresh," A few rough edges, but has a lot to say about finding love whether you're gay or straight."
rotten," It's a dark, frequently disturbing and occasionally terrifying film that suggests Barker's vision hasn't quite made the conversion from paper to celluloid."
fresh," Didn't really make any sense, but it didn't matter because a monster basically used an ICBM for a dildo at one point and it was all I could do not to throw confetti in the air and run around my seat with joy."
rotten," DVC is a freakish book and a lavishly ludicrous film, a bouncing mass of high-priced gas given some stability by culture-tour settings (even Isaac Newton's tomb and, of course, the Mona Lisa) and by Hanks' solid, sensible presence."
rotten," There is not enough space here to detail the plot, which is basically about two boys whose paths are swapped on the evening of India's independence."
rotten, This generic offering simply doesn't transcend the tropes of the genre at hand.
fresh," Darren Aronofsky's Mother! is a masterpiece that might make even fans of extreme horror movies wince. It's stylish, complex and superbly acted by Jennifer Lawrence, the titular mother."
rotten," Neither Curtis Hanson nor the fellow veteran director who replaced him when Hanson took ill, Michael Apted, can do much with the hokey sequences on land."
rotten, A movie that says so little does not deserve this star-studded cast.
rotten, The jaunty style of a hit TV series has been replaced by huge spasms of false energy and a sense of barely concealed flop sweat.
fresh, Basically this entire review is just my love letter to Lily James' acting career.
rotten," Ill-conceived and oddly executed, this Will Smith vehicle perplexes more often than it entertains."
fresh," A coming-of-age story that also examines the pull and push of the modern and traditional, Tulpan is a striking, unique, narrative feature debut for director-writer Sergei Dvortsevoy."
fresh, Intelligence and wit make MIB 3 a winner.
rotten, Olive's attempts to fold three uniquely wrenching stories into one wide-ranging feature only further highlights how hard it can be to bridge that gap.
fresh," Two love stories -- one at the end of Tolstoy's turbulent 48-year marriage, the other at its beginning -- intersect at a rail station."
rotten, Who knew 'Dumb And Dumber' would turn out to be one of the most influential films of all time?
rotten, The result is a well-made invitation to nod off.
rotten, Watching Steve Martin in Cheaper by the Dozen 2 is like watching Emeril manning the kitchen at Arbys.
rotten," Matlin's dramatizations are intentionally heavy-handed... Meanwhile, many of the dozen-plus panelists grossly over-ponder the many scientific observations made."
rotten," Ah, the hardship of being rich and famous!"
rotten," Given the choice between handcrafted whimsy and heavy-handedness, we'll take the former, thanks."
rotten, The gift shop DVD from an exciting horse farm.
rotten," Too shallow and incurious to succeed as a character study, the film drifts aimlessly in a manner that frustrates and finally alienates."
fresh," The refreshing thing about this otherwise formulaic romantic comedy is that writer-director Tom Gormican gives the verbal humor some rhythm, shooting many of the dialogue-driven scenes in long takes so they develop a pleasing ebb and flow."
rotten, It's just all so pointless. I seriously felt like I got nothing out of watching the thing other than feelings of slight annoyance.
rotten," Folks, I confess: I'm coping with a mild case of arachno-apatha-phobia, defined as the fear of another so-so ""Spider-Man"" sequel."
fresh," Add to this some winningly low-key performances, a slacker sensibility that refuses to subscribe to the American Dream, and some genuine laughs, and you have a film that feels both wise and real."
rotten, A one-act play in search of a black box theater and an audience unfamiliar with such intense cat-and-mouse character studies as 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'
fresh," Like its eponymous protagonist, Terri sits awkwardly outside mainstream expectations, but is all the more appealing for it."
fresh," An immensely enjoyable, if predictable, ride."
fresh," Clearly, Pixar's genius for adventurous storytelling continues unabated; a prison film would seem to be the furthest idea from safe, but the tale poses a serious challenge to the old saw of terrible second sequels."
rotten," Dear horror movies, ENOUGH WITH THE GODDAMN SHAKY-CAM!"
fresh," a safe, enjoyable movie that can be watched by yourself, on a date or at your mother's house after Sunday dinner"
rotten, A sense of duty and a desire to create pretty pictures ... aren't exactly compelling reasons to mount a cinematic adaptation of a celebrated novel.
fresh," Cary Elwes is far more dashing and jubilant than either Kevin Costner or Russell Crowe, and he seems born for the role, rather than shoehorned into it."
fresh, Cumberbatch makes the least immediately likable of the Marvel heroes into the most unpredictable and intriguing.
fresh, The most interesting part of Elstree 1976 comes when these actors express ambivalence about their odd celebrity.
fresh, Downey imbues this superhero with a heart that glows as radiantly as the power reactor implants in his chest.
rotten," After all the other animated CGI films this year, Planet 51 just feels like a rehash, and not nearly as charming as it wants to be."
fresh," The Zookeeper's Wife has powerful moments, but it fails to truly convey the emotional depths of the situation."
fresh, McDonald propels things at a velocity that keeps you watching long after it's stopped making sense.
rotten," Even with a bizarre public hanging and some animated shootings, the action scenes felt insipid, while the humor didn't improve."
rotten," Lacks the energy of the first two but should still please the kiddies. Still, the franchise seems to have run out of gas. "
fresh," By the time Tom Mullen has turned into an action superhero in a clumsy climax, Ransom has run out of ideas, and we've lost track of what we felt about a father's frantic efforts to save his son."
rotten," Heartbreaker's best ideas come courtesy of There's Something About Mary, while its worst are ripped straight from the rom-com boilerplate."
fresh," With a stacked cast, breathtaking production design and sensitive, heartfelt storytelling, Black Panther is a refreshing and exciting movie that promises to take the superhero genre to new heights."
fresh," It doesn't break any new ground or have any new ideas. It is just a perfectly cast, well-written, well-directed, well-acted film that is bloody funny."
rotten, Fails to provide either Craven's trademark chills or Williamson's trademark satirical wit.
rotten, The courtroom procedural elements and Amir's interrogation are riveting...but other scenes are undone by poor TV-movie level acting.
rotten," The film wanted for grit, and for context. Where we needed Johnny Marr, we got only James Corden. Where we could have done with a Simon Reynolds-style figure, we had to make do with a nodding Mark Ronson."
fresh," It's enjoyable and fun to watch, but just barely touches the surface of its own narrative."
rotten," Flashy, but not well thought out."
rotten, Practically any one scene from the original film oozes more creativity and humor than the whole of Jungle Book 2.
fresh," Beneath the moving acting, soaring music, and powerful images is a story. And what a story. "
fresh, As tough-spirited as fans would hope for - and exciting and thought-provoking in a way few adventure dramas ever are.
rotten, Remarkable only in how brazenly it embraces the tired yet proven formula that these modern ghost tales deal in.
fresh, The Silence of the Lambs is pop film making of a high order. It could well be the first big hit of the year.
rotten," High hopes, flat results."
fresh, One of the most powerful war stories to appear on screen. A story of the universal defeat of war and the enduring survival of the human spirit.
rotten," To be frank, The Legacy of a Whitetail Deer Hunter is definitely the worst film Hill and McBride have made together, but if you're a longtime fan, there's still plenty to giggle at here. "
fresh," Sugar makes you fat. That, predictably, is what the young Australian film-maker Damon Gameau discovers for himself from his own expanding midriff in this engaging, Super Size Me-style doc."
rotten, There's a certain thrill to seeing humans face off against Frogger. If only as much care had been put into the living characters as the pixelated ones.
rotten, A disaster from start to finish.
rotten, The Hughes Bros.' take on The Ripper makes one long for the more edgy action of their Menace II Society.
rotten, Bad Santa 2 doesn't hate Christmas. It just hates women.
fresh," Reichardt in no way pushes her material, instead giving the viewer the space to live in this space with the characters, observe them and listen to them, and then draw one's own conclusions about thematic import."
rotten, So mannered and discreet that it's dull.
rotten," Good news: you've got great actors with wonderful chemistry and comic timing. Bad News: they're playing some of the most irritating, unlikable, infuriating characters ever committed to film"
rotten," There's only a token black character in a movie set in Atlanta, where blacks outnumber whites by no small margin - Georgia's film tax credits must be incentive to lure more white people into the city."
fresh," Disney's new (yet not quite novel), musical (yet not quite memorable), 3-D (yet so what) animated retelling of the Grimm brothers' Rapunzel."
rotten," The Sony hacking disaster may draw some attention to the movie, but Blackhat is strictly Hollywood hokum with a limited shelf life."
fresh, Doctor Strange will obliterate your expectations. It is an enormously entertaining film; a rousing cinematic adventure loaded with stunning visual effects.
rotten," Ultimately, there's a sense of just one thing after another, linked only by an overarching aura of portent that the characters themselves seem to be complicit in."
rotten," ""Kidnap"" was shot in 2014 and has been sitting on the shelf for two years. Frankly, it should have stayed missing."
fresh, It is our awareness that five of the brightest French stars have come together to have fun that makes the picture bubble.
fresh," A poignant, unsettling and moving psychological drama about an unworldly 18-year-old novitiate nun."
rotten," Not terrible, but kind of ho-hum. Not up to Curtis Hanson's usual standard. "
fresh," Not to be taken seriously. But, ridiculous as the film is, it's loads of fun"
rotten," An Evening with Beverly Luff Linn is a stylistic exercise in unpleasantness. There's an audience that enjoys such torture, but I'm not among their ranks."
fresh," There are a lot of thrilling moments in Ransom, but the film that connects them can't quite live up to the exiting highs."
fresh," As a young flower child traipsing and/or sleeping her way around Europe, Donna is the ultimate carefree white girl(TM) on paper, but James makes that label enviable in the exact way it's supposed to be."
rotten," Ritchie is just going through the gangster motions, and almost all the entertainment value has vanished."
fresh," In a film where dialogue comes at a premium, Van Sant allows his camera to do the talking, and when it rests too long on one subject, the commentary feels like overstatement. Elsewhere, 'Paranoid Park' is eloquent in its terseness."
fresh, It's the best English language teen LGBT film in recent years.
rotten, [A] glorified simplification of adolescence and an excrutiatingly precious recreation of WWII-era Americana.
rotten," Not quite wrath, more a persistant crossness, and in the case of Rosamund Pike's Andromeda, a kind of pained, headmistressy dismay."
fresh," Tina Fey and Paul Rudd rise above the inconsistent, elitist, borderline obnoxious material, as does irrepressible Lily Tomlin."
fresh," Understated and thought-provoking, and alongside The Visitor should establish Abbass as a major female presence in international cinema."
rotten," The trouble is the angrier it gets, the more infuriatingly banal it becomes."
fresh," Sorrentino's juxtaposition of contemporary Roman indulgence and the Eternal City's place in history's imagination makes for a bittersweet epic in which a solitary character, Jep, stands in for the director, and us, and experiences an epiphany."
fresh, This eccentric film might just be Jaco van Dormael's best work yet. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten," While Criminal had a lot going for it, it simply fails to execute anything it tries to do to a competent degree. "
rotten, It's clear that Japanese director Naomi Kawase has poured her heart and soul into every frame of this wishy-washy drama... That makes it all the more depressing that the end results are so resoundingly uninvolving and off-putting.
rotten," The film struggles to mimic the simple, sublime truths which make Daniel Handler's books so appealingly vibrant."
fresh," Impeccably, nay astonishingly, performed by Mira Barkhammar, Mira Grosin and Liv LeMoyne, the film sweeps us into their world"
fresh, The magic is lost on the very young because of the films' even darker tone.
fresh," An exploration and subversion of the unstated theme of 'Species' and its ilk: the fear of female sexuality, and the fantasy scenarios that are all tied up in those fears."
fresh," Robert Altman's wintry 1971 anti-Western gives Warren Beatty one of his best roles as the doomed gambler McCabe: boastful, shy, foolish, altogether lovable."
rotten," Open endings work for some movies, but a story this depressing needs some resolution."
fresh," It's hard for me to talk about this film without just hurling adjectives at the page; it's tender, beautiful, sexy, hilarious and deeply moving - a romance story for the ages, directed and acted with a passionate sincerity."
fresh," Just as brave and loyal Katniss Everdeen is the heart of the wildly popular series of ""Hunger Games"" novels, Jennifer Lawrence is the heart of this faithful adaptation."
rotten, Shock value can only carry you so far.
fresh," Washington towers above everything in this impressive, tough and long crime drama, convincingly putting his stamp on the elegant man whose callousness alternates with chivalry"
fresh, Elegantly performed and beautifully shot.
rotten," Will offer a mild diversion to the action aficionadoes, but even those who like the flick will probably erase it from their memory banks in less than a week."
rotten," The ad for it claims, The Punishment Begins April 16. And boy, does it. About 1 hour, 59 minutes worth of punishment."
fresh," ...portrays the teenagers as living in a world of their own, and of their own creation, with a specific culture that is largely impenetrable even to the adults in their own community. "
rotten, Dog Days is a really tough film to watch.
fresh, Mary Poppins commits murder most foul in this slight but worthwhile comedy that proudly displays its droll British humor at every turn.
fresh," What ""This is It"" accomplishes is key to not only preserving Jackson's memory, but also to galvanizing his myth. Onstage, he still moonwalks, but there are new moves to be had here and a voice that is still strong."
rotten," This is the Magpie School of action filmmaking: Anytime things start to make so little sense that you might lose the audience, just throw something shiny up on screen to distract."
rotten," A programmatic wash, suitable for the bottom half of a double bill, perhaps, if only we had such things anymore."
rotten," Dunkirk left me feeling vaguely dissatisfied, with too many unanswered questions. For me it missed the big picture. If that means I'm swimming against the tide, so be it."
rotten," Unfortunately, the main couple in the film competes in vain against the scenery."
fresh," Its protagonist and story may not have changed much, but [director Chad] Stahelski has more than a few new tricks up his sleeve."
fresh, This movie relishes in the awkwardness of starting life in the bottom year of a new school.
rotten, There's obviously an audience for these things and they'll get exactly what they're looking for
fresh," Director Hossein Amini sometimes overplays his hand... but the acting is excellent, with Mortensen particularly strong as his character's cool façade begins to crack."
fresh," The sensual photography, music and locations are so entrancing ... they help the viewer to overlook the weak storyline, which prefers psychological ambiguity to solid police work."
rotten," Tired, uninspired."
rotten," Perhaps the shortest straw was drawn by Ezra Miller, whose talents are far too great for the measly part he's given."
rotten," Every once in a while, a movie comes along that makes you scratch your head and ask yourself, ""What were they thinking?"" Nine Lives is one of those movies."
rotten," Whether Ghost in the Shell's story is faithful or not, it feels empty, and the final product feels like a missed opportunity."
rotten," A bloated melodrama more interested in poses than inner lives (according to some Japanese-culture-vultures, it gets the poses wrong, too)."
rotten," Even though the melodrama gets ratcheted up at the end, there were plenty of moments I found myself cheering for the Champ."
fresh," Keeps succeeding in spite of itself, thanks mostly to Witherspoon's beautifully energized performance."
rotten, Less likely to haunt an audience than simply bore them to death.
fresh," Takahata brings his own feminist spin to Kaguya's coming of age, showing how this child of nature is repeatedly kept from happiness by the forces of patriarchy."
fresh," In 3D, it's a knockout -- you'll think you've experienced the greatest tooth-brushing scene in movie history."
fresh," The drama is subtle, the execution is deceptively unassuming and, yet, beneath its placid surface you can sense the weary melancholy of a man who has constantly struggled to make his voice heard and his vision seen."
fresh, Not since...My Cousin Vinny has there been a more charming class-clash comedy-drama than Junebug.
rotten, A colorful brochure; a Watchtower for new-age mysticism
fresh," Not exactly a fun watch ... but it does an excellent job showing us many facets of Houston, and it's worth knowing who she was beyond the broad strokes."
rotten," The best one can say is that his version is not slavishly in thrall to Hooper's: boring, fright-free and pointless, maybe, but not craven."
rotten," This is exercise-bike cinema: energetic, relentless and tipping towards monotony."
rotten," No animals were used, and no humans were entertained in the making of this movie."
rotten," Ruby Sparks opts for a seemingly darker but ultimately easier resolution, one that involves magic and fantasy and the sort of neat, happily-ever-after finales that only exist in movies."
rotten," Over the course of 90-odd minutes its charm wears very, very thin."
rotten," The film steals elements from supernatural classics such as The Omen, The Exorcist, and The Ring. ... The elements don't add up to anything more than a muddle."
fresh," Have the movies ever talked this quickly, before or since?"
rotten," [Richard] Donner can direct this sort of thriller in his sleep, but he squanders the movie's sense of urgency for little acting or screen-writing indulgences."
rotten," Frankly, it is bizarre that this Chinese-French Canadian production would be so tone-deaf and insensitive."
rotten, Once upon a time-passer.
fresh," The movie may be slight and a bit predictable, but these two actors are wonderful to watch."
fresh," It may not tell you who you should vote for, but Team America: World Police conclusively proves everything is funnier when it's done by marionettes."
rotten, Scream 4? More like a wheeze.
fresh, Meet the Fockers is not much of a movie -- just a lot of comic situations barely held together by the semblance of a plot -- but it is genuinely funny in a crass way.
rotten," Sometimes, you can tell when parts of a movie have been left on the cutting room floor, and that's the case with Daredevil."
rotten," Senior-citizen buddy comedy has salty language, sex. "
rotten," Nothing looks quite real, and in lieu of being any good or engaging you emotionally, the film pounds you into submission."
fresh, The humour is British - low key but often barbed - and the filmmakers manage to control the tone of the film through the many elements of the human experience from love and art to death and broken relationships. 
rotten, Some laughs while you are watching but that old deja vu feeling just won't go away.
rotten," Come for the film, stay for the urban-mural visuals, leave vaguely satisfied."
fresh, Many people can't abide slow-building subtitled films about relentlessly unhappy people. But closet pessimists like myself and the Cannes judges will find Elena's sense of impending doom oddly satisfying.
fresh," Kingsman is entertaining in its way and occasionally clever, but also relentlessly smug and sexist. "
fresh," While one may expect a little more consistency from a film with such acclaim, consistency is hardly the order of the day when one is making iconoclastic and unconventional movies like Anderson does."
rotten," Everyone loves a good David vs. Goliath story, but there's a point where reality kicks in."
rotten, Paris Can Wait simply flickers away inoffensively in the background. It's just there.
rotten, A genre mash that's mildly amusing until it can't think of anything else to do besides flop around in the deep end of conspicuous gore.
rotten," The movie streaks along its two-hour course without ever being much in the way of exciting, funny, or moving."
fresh," Regina Hall nails the role of her career in this darkly comic expose of the ""breastaurant"" experience."
fresh," What begins as a family drama centered around the tragic loss of their son, somehow manages to turn into an over-the-top action extravaganza."
rotten," Doug Liman's latest effort Jumper has so many problems, so many things that are just plain haywire, so many dangling intangibles left unexplained (or, worse, unexplored) trying to recap them all here would take the rest of this young millennium."
fresh," Starts slow, but gathers momentum as it proceeds toward a fascinating and just conclusion for all concerned."
rotten," I mean, honestly, how does somebody screw up a Yeti attack?"
fresh," Almost impossibly sweet, a tale of love and kindness that's funny without being snarky."
fresh," A former storyboard artist, Davis orchestrates the film's nearly wall-to-wall action sequences with breakneck precision and exhilarating verve -- the more outrageous the mayhem, the better."
fresh," That air of gritty realism, shorn of typical slasher-flick misogynist titillation, makes the film often seem punishingly graphic-even though the worst of the torturing abuses Vicki and a predecessor suffer are actually left offscreen... "
rotten, Hank Greenberg is a cozy affair that leaves the impression of a filmmaker too close to the material.
fresh," Novack follows Talley's lead, but at a polite distance."
rotten, Meyers-Shyer has been stealing mom's notes because she too has found a fondness for the ludicrous romantic entanglements of the elite class.
rotten," But even for me, an animal lover, a believer in the power of storytelling, and an advocate for meatless meals as often as possible, I just kept waiting for a revelation, or a reason (beyond the horror show footage) to care."
fresh," The defining chapter in the next step of the world's biggest film series, Avengers: Infinity War has to be seen on the big screen in order to be truly appreciated."
fresh," Although the casting of Cruise takes some getting used to, the film makes ample use of a strong supporting cast and a tightly knit story to maintain suspense."
rotten, Without any period-specific music to help establish a sense of time and place-a real cultural backdrop-even the setting remains a little fuzzy.
fresh," A Star Is Born, is simply terrific -- a big-scale cinematic delight that will have the masses singing, swooning and sobbing along with it."
fresh, ... Builds off its 2013 predecessor in all the best ways and is the best pure horror film I've seen in years.
fresh, Smart dialogue is key to make this an effective and thrilling story full of moral dilemmas and suspense. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh, A solid crime thriller.
rotten, ...[A] moping melodramatic malaise. Ridiculously artificial in its Cupid-driven cornucopia of sketchy endearment. [Rodanthe] has the forceful flair of an unlit wax candle.
fresh, Few works in cinema can prudently and soberly be described as religious experiences: 2001 A Space Odyssey is one of them.
rotten," With so many years spent on it, Wong should have been able to see that the structure wasn't coming together and that his characters needed further work."
rotten," In its gore, Hatchet is not especially inventive"
fresh, Whedon is on to a winning formula.
rotten, A clumsy character drama that turns one of history's most interesting and heart-breaking natural disasters into a tiresome and unmoving cinematic experience.
fresh," [Director Arantxa Echevarria] not only respects the characters, she respects her two actresses. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh, It's a quiet film built of careful details.
fresh, Satisfaction guaranteed? Pretty much.
fresh, [Besson] has attained two striking performances from his leads and many of the individual scenes pack quite a punch as a result.
rotten, It's like the worst movie Jean-Claude Van Damme never made.
rotten," For all its slow-mo kick-flying and computer-generated mysticism, the story is tissue-thin and simple to the point of being simpleminded."
fresh," Unlike Conviction, this film opts out of DNA/exoneration heartbreak as a triumphant dramatic tool, and goes directly for the post-9/11 paranoia, righteously rebellious jugular instead. So is one man's terrorist another man's Russell Crowe? You bet."
rotten," Agent Cody Banks meets post-shark jump 24, with what appears to be an 8-year-old Soviet body builder in the lead role."
rotten, Inside Out lacks laugh out loud humor and its lazy animation is disheartening. Pixar films are known to pack an emotional punch and this doesn't have any of that. All it has to offer is a misguided heart that is visually displeasing.
rotten," Along the way, the film is bogged down by its dramatic twists and turns."
rotten," At its core, it's another glossy rom-com about a woman dithering in an unhealthy relationship while another, better, meeker suitor waits in the wings."
rotten, It's so bad it's not even entertaining. The only reason I didn't dread having to talk about this movie is the eavesdropping shark.
rotten," Over Her Dead Body is the kind of date movie that could bring a relationship to a screeching halt. If your date likes it, go back to Match.com."
fresh, A gloriously inventive little comedy about the scholastic and romantic woes of a 15-year-old student at a private academy.
fresh," Acaba se perdendo na necessidade de incluir elaboradas sequências de ação e de ser um ""filme de super-herói"" em vez de insistir na ideia de ser um filme sobre um humano que tem superpoderes."
fresh, Almost everyone seems at ease in this feather-light production which eschews the Bardolatry that accompanies more declamatory Shakespeare movie versions.
rotten," After a while, you want. . .the characters to evince some level of real feeling, ugly, extreme, agonized, whatever, as long as there is something that breaks the spell."
rotten," Neither dramatic enough to qualify as drama nor amusing enough to completely succeed as comedy, it's the kind of movie that coasts on pleasantness, content to elicit a few smiles before disappearing from memory banks."
rotten, A passably conventional rom-com squishfest decked out with Smith's usual pop-culture references.
fresh," It's the best tear-jerker in a long time; one box of tissues might not be enough. On a deeper level, it earns some of that emotion through a story based on a real dilemma."
rotten," Amateurishly staged and unevenly acted, this microbudget indie serves as ample evidence that, absent a unifying aesthetic and artistic hand on the tiller, a camera simply turned back upon ""real life"" does not a compelling movie make."
fresh," just know this: ""Blockers"" is the John Cena show. "
rotten," [Category 6: Day of Destruction], a miniseries one step beyond devastatingly awful."
fresh," There is no Team America-style, flag-waving bravado behind this story - it is quite the opposite."
fresh, Some efficient genre thrills.
rotten," Far too much of this wildly uneven Netflix-bound comedy plays less like a transgressive farce than an overextended ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch. "
fresh," Every seemingly insignificant, color-coded fragment of the picture's makeup coheres into a satisfying whole."
rotten," If you're looking for comedy to be served up, better look elsewhere."
rotten," Dry, if painstakingly-detailed, account of how four of the proverbial smartest guys in the room accurately predicted the global financial collapse of 2008."
fresh, Essential movieness.
fresh," Breathtaking, stylish and wise. A highly immersive experience. "
rotten," This is a strange, unclassifiable piece of work, bordering on craziness and incoherence but acted and directed with such quiet vehemence that it has some interest."
rotten, As pointless as it is shocking.
fresh," It's still a wonderful time at the movies by turns, a grand adventure, a great inspiration, and a missing chapter In what it means to be human."
fresh," Fans know exactly what they're in for when going to a Paranormal Activity movie, and in that respect The Marked Ones delivers."
rotten, It already seems more dated than Trading Places - not to mention less savvy about all the subjects it pretends to be addressing while it tries to make us laugh.
fresh," Antichrist is an original, gothic and combative; a perfect night at the movies for those who enjoy cold sweats and the inevitability of post-screening divorce proceedings."
rotten," Preachy, worthy and far too wordy, Lions For Lambs doesn't roar so much as bleat. Less a movie than a bungled party political broadcast on behalf on the United Artists party."
fresh," ""We the Animals"" is a tough story, but also life-affirming. It races along like a child going every which way before stopping in its tracks and landing an emotional wallop."
fresh, An Oscar-nominated win for more than just political junkies.
rotten, Tommy Lee Jones deadpan stoicism and Will Smith's quasi-hip parlance doesn't add up to much in this film.
fresh," Shows Singer exercising some much-needed control over the franchise he built 14 years ago and wrangling a lot of loose ends -- a welcome return, and although the material itself is a little unwieldy, it successfully brings together characterizations."
rotten," Feels unfinished, like a rough cut still awaiting a much-needed polish. Fleetingly amusing? Yes. Full-out magical? Not so much."
rotten," Like Jones' divisive Warcraft, Mute is uncompromising. But compromise isn't the worst thing in the world."
rotten," They should've called this movie ""Playing It Safe."""
rotten," It has some atrocious acting, and somehow Dornan manages to keep his trousers on for the first two-thirds of the movie. But (and I know this is damning with faint praise) it's not completely awful and Johnson in particular is rather good. "
rotten," As rancid as its title is lurid, an example of pulp fiction run amok."
fresh, Diggs on screen is intense. He is a movie star.
rotten," Far from seeming like a strategic element created to define Lady Gaga's reinvention, the documentary instead feels like a natural outgrowth of it. "
rotten," Despite meticulous acting, Bill Condon's film fails to bring emotional heft to  the tragedy of the aging and gradual disappearance of the human intellect."
fresh, Reynolds and Cortés deserve credit for their ambition and Buried is a tense but enjoyable experience for anyone interested in the core 'buried alive' concept.
rotten," It is vengeance porn dressed up as an important film, a reverse slasher movie feigning some weak pretense of meaning beyond its own bloodlust."
rotten, [I]t might have been nice if the documentary had worked a bit harder to find a real internal narrative.
fresh," Portman's been a committed, in-the-moment actress since she was a skinny kid running after ""Leon: The Professional"" but ""Jackie"" is an accomplishment on the Oscar-winning order of ""Black Swan."""
fresh, An uproarious hip-hop spin on Airplane! boasting just the right mix of sass and sentiment.
fresh," Older kids, fans of the book and parents who remember the fun of reading dark stories under the covers should be happily engrossed in this adventure."
rotten," Michael Clayton literally knocks its brains out trying to be clever, but it ends up being the same kind of smart-alecky filmmaking most of Mr. Clooney's movies are famous for."
rotten," ...it's as if Joe Berlinger was sidetracked from delving into Whitey Bulger's crimes for a greater goal, offering up only a distracted and stretched-thin story in its place."
fresh," On its own ""10 years past expiration date"" level, it's good fun."
rotten," This is 50 First Dates-dark, but lacking that film's humor, characterizations, dramatic interest, and consistency."
rotten," Nothing about this makes sense, even by the standards of bad horror movies."
fresh, A tense journey of psychological despair. 
fresh," In its nakedly revealed tremors of fear and insecurity, Affleck's tour de force is reminiscent of the similarly raw work of the late, great John Cazale."
fresh," This well-directed, serviceable yarn proves the importance of casting - especially when we're spending nearly two hours with just two actors."
fresh," Though it's an accomplished production, Vanity Fair ranks as a standard costume drama populated by snide old biddies, aging lords and ladies, manipulative business barons and dashing soldiers."
rotten, The Fountain is not an unmitigated disaster -- just a disappointment from an undeniably talented filmmaker.
rotten, Does not provide enough 'clues' to Sophie's emotional background to make us care whether or not she survives the trauma of 7/11.
fresh," This Belgian drama is the real deal, an alternately wrenching and ecstatic viewing experience, adapted from a play by lead actor Johan Heldenbergh."
fresh," Though fans might miss the levity that made Richard Donner's classic 1978 film Superman: The Movie such a game-changing joy, the thing that really sells this respectful reboot is the dramatic conviction underlying all the mega-scale mayhem."
rotten," The stultifying voiceover meant to nuance Georg's actions is only more evidence of Petzold's navel-gazing; and although it remains a nostalgic treat, his classical visual sense fails to organize the unruly material."
rotten, The film falls short of its initially obvious dramatic goals due to the shallow depths that screenwriters Geoff Deane and Tim Firth take their characters.
fresh," Hacksaw Ridge is a movie for anyone who has felt like an outcast. It captures the feeling of having to defend one's values and stand by one's convictions, looking left when everyone is telling you to look right. It's brutal. Tense. "
rotten, The 90-minute runtime torpedoes any sympathy for the character viewers may still hold after more than a decade away.
rotten," A pity that, other than the fights, everything else in the movie is equally bloodless."
fresh," A film that pulls us in and challenges us with ideas and emotions that are deeply resonant, even as the plot builds a gripping sense of tension. And in addition to the twisty, tricky filmmaking style, the performances carry a striking emotional kick."
rotten," The first half of Jai Simha sets the pace for the film well, making one curious to where this is all heading. But post-interval, the film takes not just a predictable path, but also a borderline nonsensical one."
rotten, A film without mirth or magic.
rotten," ""Tron: Legacy""? How about ""Tron: Tedious,"" instead?"
fresh," It's more a taut psychological thriller than a geek show. And in doing away with the original's reliance on dialogue to make clear its ideological thrust, Eisner has crafted a leaner and more effective film."
rotten, Neo's acting is passable but most of the characters are cringe-inducing caricatures.
fresh, [Stillman] nails his characters with perfectly heard dialogue and laconic satire.
rotten," Personally, I found the remake weaker than the original (which was only vaguely interesting anyway; then again, it's pretty much the same movie)."
rotten, The main question Rosewater grapples with is whether Stewart can hack it as a filmmaker. The answer: sort of?
fresh," The Man From London checks in as good but not great Tarr, more on the level of his first mature work, Damnation (1987), than one to sit at the Olympian table of Satan's Tango and Werckmeister Harmonies."
rotten," As it stands, for Eastwood, The Mule might be something new, though for the rest of us it fulfills all the expected beats of its narrative."
fresh," A fun, stylistic flick that seems like something Slumdog Millionaire director Danny Boyle would do if he wanted to make a D.A.R.E. commercial."
rotten," This astonishingly unfunny Paramount comedy is burdened with writing, direction and acting that would cause Ed Wood to wince."
fresh, The best foreign film Oscar-winner is a tautly plotted political thriller of moral heft and fierce intelligence. A masterpiece.
rotten," The Predator offers some cosmetic changes to the heroes and the aliens. In other words, it provides nothing that's really new."
fresh, ...ultimately feels like the sort of movie that'll improve immeasurably on repeat viewings...
rotten," Ridley Scott's long-awaited prequel-of-sorts to his game-changing 1979 classic sci-fi terror ride Alien is not only conceptually lame and badly made, it's actually worse than Alien Resurrection."
rotten, A romantic comedy that looks smutty but is actually slushy.
rotten," It's a paper-thin thriller that positions itself as a movie about the consequences of drone warfare, but it's really just a threadbare domestic drama with delusions of contemporary relevance."
fresh," Of course, it's a showcase of great acting, as you would expect, but The Dresser is also a well-tailored play enriched by layers of metaphor and irony."
rotten," While two of the tales retain a satisfying bite, the experiment as a whole is tiring and often ridiculous, spending most of its energy supporting a concept that wears out its welcome after ten minutes of exposure. "
rotten," A better title for this film would have been ""Murphy's Law,"" as Inarritu has a relentless grip on the banality of its tenets."
fresh, Scott Thomas and Duff are both phenomenal as they fight over the young boy.
fresh," A hardly effective buddy-movie with moderated humor bits, courtesy of Dwayne Johnson's charisma. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh," Where it's going all seems predetermined, but the visual journey is lovely, Robbie Ryan's camera turning even council-housing London into something optically enchanting."
rotten, What a weird movie.
rotten, All of Black Nativity proceeds with sort of clumsy obviousness. 
rotten," It's a movie about finding purpose in life, late in life, that makes its point by first subjecting its characters to the most reductive grumpy-old-men/women shenanigans."
rotten," Dolly Parton and Queen Latifah going head-to-head in a movie together should have been a contender for the Sassiest Movie of 2012, but the result was soulless."
rotten," It is not about conclusiveness, but about solving the immediate struggles of its own stupid sci-fi details."
rotten," Overdrive provides just enough crash-and-burn stunt action to satisfy undemanding thrill-seekers, but not much else."
rotten," A decorous restraint pervades Tom of Finland - which, given its subject matter, can't help but seem puzzling; Karukoski never manages to capture the hedonistic excess of Laaksonen's art."
rotten, There is some really dark stuff going on underneath all the outrageous goofiness...
fresh," For what is essentially a one-joke movie, this has an awful lot going for it."
fresh," Blake navigates the morally vague world of being a sugar baby with complete control over her body and needs, which is what makes The New Romantic utterly genuine."
rotten, This is pre-adolescent humour. I'm sorry. I don't mean to be rude to pre-adolescents.
fresh," The quirky-misfits-on-the-road genre is nothing new or revolutionary, but the film possesses a naive charm that is as refreshing as it is rare."
fresh, A raunchy unpleasant comedy that wastes its talented cast.
fresh, Brilliantly original and very highly recommended.
rotten, BGMC loses power under the load of its heavy-duty screenplay.
fresh," Hereditary adds itself to a small, but juicy list of films who carefully and patiently create terror for audiences. [Full Review in Spanish]"
fresh," ""Novitiate"" has no weak moments. It is flawless --- especially for a novice director."
rotten, Has all the complexity and realistic human behavior of an episode of General Hospital.
rotten," Set in Los Angeles among a group of young people who dream of becoming famous, Undiscovered carries more than a whiff of the self-referential."
rotten," It's pretty funny, actually, that Stallone gained 40 pounds to play this role, and what the movie needs more than anything else is to eat a salad and do some sit-ups."
rotten, It's a really earnest adventure set in the second century. And you know what that means. It means you have to tune your brain back to at least the 1950s.
fresh," We can read the character's history in Letts' face before we know the details. He's miserable, but like he's gotten used to misery. Misery is no big deal."
fresh, Anne Hathaway winds up stealing the whole film. [Full Review in Spanish]
fresh," A good movie, for a movie that shouldn't exist...I know Disney is re-making and sequel-izing everything they have in their properties..."
fresh," A disappointing follow-up to the sublime Flowers of Shanghai and minor work in the oeuvre of one of the world's best filmmakers. Even so, this rambling story of a young woman (new star Shu Qi) torn between two loves is visually impressive."
fresh," But what does all of this really mean? Not a whole lot. It's a very fun watch, if this is what you're into. "
fresh," Horror films are supposed to be scary, but not very smart. The Cabin in the Woods is both. It's about as clever as you can imagine a film of this type being that is also this wicked and this brutal."
fresh," A one-of-a-kind film that lingers long in the memory, ""The Red Turtle"" suggests that when it comes to animation, there are still whole new worlds to explore."
fresh," A very well-executed farce, and Brooks' most underrated movie."
fresh, A stable of strong supporting characters often makes a film whole and one may even eclipse a lead. Marcia Gay Harden takes the cake over Thomas Jane in The Mist as a hysterical religious vessel.
fresh," Despite its contrivances and flashiness, City of Men somehow wins you over with its steady, underlying flow of intimacy and compassion."
fresh," A film that's better directed than written, in which Emilio Martinez-Lazaro shines even in the most physical comedy. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten," Rarely competent, unintentionally hilarious and borderline reprehensible in both its politics and its take on gender roles."
rotten," I'm a great fan of Blade, the Marvel Comics vampire hunter played by Wesley Snipes... But a third episode, Blade: Trinity, directed by David S. Goyer, is a blood fest too far."
rotten, It works so strenuously to deliver its message that it threatens to short-circuit what otherwise could have been a gut-punch of a film.
fresh," Riveting and sincere, Anucha Boonyawatana's powerful feature film bluntly, but calmly reminds us of the inescapable reality of death."
fresh," For this slight but charming comedy set on the 1920s Riviera, Woody Allen revisits some of his favourite themes: magic; metaphysics; the romantic pairing of an older actor with a younger actress."
rotten," The Perfect Guy manages to deliver a handful of tawdry thrills and remains solidly watchable thanks to its classy cast, but it lacks the ambition to rise above generic thriller box-ticking."
rotten," Over-acted, over-directed but dully directed."
rotten, Has Roman Polanski lost his movie mojo?
rotten," By rubbing your nose in this hillbilly mayhem, Zombie all but dares you to acknowledge your liberal elitism."
rotten," Even Jim Carrey, whose mere presence can often liven up a film lacking in luster, can't save the almighty turkey that is ""Bruce Almighty."""
fresh," Working with a gutsy script by The Sopranos' Terence Winter, Scorsese is jabbing hard at America's jackpot culture. The laughs are merciless and nonstop, every one with a sting in its tail."
fresh, Where Downsizing starts to get interesting is in Paul's transition from happy miniature cog in the consumerist machine to a seeker of some broader truth.
rotten, The trite tropes are thick but Saroo's drama remains undramatized and we remain mostly unmoved.
fresh," Gibson has succeeded in making the definitive look at the final 12 hours in the life of Jesus, with a movie that is gut-wrenching in both its violence and inhumanity."
fresh," A funny movie with some decent action scenes, Stone was a big blockbuster when it came out, but hasn't aged particularly well. The chemistry between the Douglas, Turner and DeVito is still fun to watch."
rotten, The characters ... are repeatedly forced to take a backseat not only to tired thriller elements but also to Campion's misplaced sense of artful abstraction.
fresh," In the final analysis, we are deliberately and cleverly left hanging, as unsure of the causes of the alienation of these children as we were when we entered the theater. That, in no small measure, is what makes this an exceptional film."
rotten, I found this film hard to embrace. Mr Watts is a strange character who seems to create problems for himself when he doesn't need to.
fresh," If Rahm feels more stagey than cinematic, it's still a gripper."
fresh, Absolutely hilarious and absolutely heartbreaking. Kristen Wiig is brilliant.
fresh, A heart-affecting drama about a beautiful 18th century woman imprisoned in a cage of wealth and privilege.
rotten," Craig Anderson's Red Christmas isn't exactly a lump of coal in your stocking, but neither is it worth waking up early for on the big day."
rotten," The movie is not unpleasant. But it is very, very, very dumb. It's so dumb that it will be a good 20 or so years before anyone dares to make a Robin Hood movie again, which really sucks, because the Robin Hood story is legitimately awesome."
rotten, Taking the kids to a matinee of Yogi Bear in 3-D is no picnic.
rotten, She kills her intended targets with sincerity and single-mindedness. Wish the film worked with the same zeal as well.
rotten," Chillingly devoid of laughs, and looks like some deconstructionist experiment, deliberately draining the comedy genre of jokes to show the parched, pointless story-skeleton beneath."
rotten, The film is certainly striking to look at but the story is hackneyed with too much exposition 
fresh," It's an interesting comparison [to Bond], particularly as Rogue Nation, perhaps more than any other M:I film, points up differences between the two spies that go far beyond accents."
fresh," A fascinating, albeit strangely downbeat, costume drama."
rotten," This desperately seeking-laughs comedy stars Anna Faris, a comedian with a lot of quirk appeal, though little of it is on display."
fresh, ...ultimately A Quiet Place emerges as an effective nightmare-maker for parents that is one of those rarest and most welcome commodities for fright-flick fans: horror with heart.
rotten," There is also a plot twist that comes about two-thirds in, which is supposed to be shocking, but is actually one of the least-surprising, least-scary 'surprises' in recent memory. It may provoke more laughter than chills."
rotten," Nothing Is Private is transgressive without being effectively subversive, gutsy to no particular end. It simply lacks style, which counts for so much in this sort of thing."
rotten, I think Lucas and Rydstrom were earnestly trying to make something different for little girls. It gives me no great pleasure to report that they have mostly failed.
rotten," Very, very violent horror flick."
fresh, This is a serious movie about drinking but not a depressing one.
rotten," It's pleasant, and at times very funny, but the meandering episodes mean that despite the long running time, the satire never builds to a payoff."
rotten," Even Travolta seems disinterested in this bloated sequel, which revisits all the old gags but doesn't possess a tenth of the energy found in the original."
fresh," It's a heavy, solemn tale of blood ties that turns into a melodramatic gusher filled with abstractions about masculinity, America and violence, but brought to specific, exciting life by Christian Bale, Casey Affleck and Woody Harrelson."
fresh," The visuals are so breathtaking, and the film initially so creepy, suspenseful and violent that the movie's weaker points are for the most part well-hidden."
fresh, The debut of a fresh vision of the all-American crowd-pleaser.
rotten," Various news stories have noted the movie's accuracy, which I don't doubt, but the blanket antipathy makes for a wearying and predictable story."
fresh," Arresting, often impassioned and technically deft proof that a film doesn't have to drone on for an hour and a half to qualify as art."
fresh, One of cinema's more mesmeric murder mystery parties.
fresh," That rare high-concept action-comedy that not only earns every one of its fairly consistent big laughs, but also provides a certain amount of pathos, too."
rotten," Malkovich and Shakespeare seem content to linger over minor things, possibly to let the audience absorb them better but to the detriment of the movie's tempo."
fresh, Runaway Bride works its way into some genuinely compelling emotional territory that Pretty Woman didn't dare acknowledge.
fresh," Up-and-coming filmmaking duo Luke Meyer and Andrew Neel's latest doc, New World Order, admirably humanizes the ""9/11 truthers,"" a seemingly impossible task they accomplish handily by never condescending to or patronizing their less-than-credible subjects."
fresh," Despite all the marketing focus on the homicidal circus freak, It was never about the clown. It's about how trauma haunts a childhood and how the latent ennui of small-town America can fan the flames of our greatest fears."
rotten," Instead of juicing it up with jokes, Brooks has inadvertently given us another story of the American condition, which is that of absolute and incorrigible self-centredness."
fresh," Captures the bittersweet, sublimely humdrum process of growing up in a way that no other single movie has done."
fresh," a delightful, thrilling and entertainingly offbeat yarn... Pfeiffer is positively spellbinding... Vaughn has given this seductive fairy tale the same dark comedy and out-of-left-field wackiness that made his first effort memorable."
rotten," Writer-director J.J. Abrams overloads this sci-fi adventure with so many homages to his co-producer Steven Spielberg that it plays like the elder director's greatest hits, minus his characteristic scares and sense of wonder."
rotten," If a bad movie arrives on streaming without a signal, does it make a sound?"
rotten, Any initial gestures toward acknowledging Vinny Paz's macho egotism are eventually downplayed as the film becomes just another formulaic triumph-over-adversity saga.
fresh," War for the Planet of the Apes does a fantastic job of rebuking toxic masculinity and centering nonverbal communication, but it forgets to lift up women or people of color in its ambitious goals."
fresh," This film isn't straight-up fisticuffs and firearms, as it also contains an old-fashioned mystery in the whodunnit vein. Hence, it's more Murder on the Orient Express and less Snakes on a Plane."
rotten," The result is a film more educational than engrossing; high schoolers should see it - the rest of us, maybe not."
fresh," Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is the best blockbuster this summer, not only exceeding the film that preceded it, but even the original franchise it's been designed to reboot."
rotten," Subtlety has never been Perry's strength, but his previous films balanced the sermonizing with good humor and sincerity. Perhaps next time, he'll ease up on the lectures, and bring back the love."
rotten," Pixels are infinitesimally small points of light - and there are, astonishingly, a scattering of them to be found in this otherwise typically abominable project from Adam Sandler's Happy Madison Productions."
rotten, David Twohy doesn't do much new and the twist is as obvious as a tornado in the Texas Panhandle. But that doesn't make it any less of an escapist joyride on a hot summer day.
rotten, Good people of Minnesota: Stand up! Fight back! Take back your state and your culture and your accent!
rotten," It's stylishly shot, reasonably watchable, not particularly crude (see Your Highness instead if that's your wish) and doesn't star Jennifer Aniston in the kind of role with which she so often flatlines."
fresh, suitably imaginative visuals and a knack for hitting the high points of the plot without missing a beat. . . a fabulously wild ride
fresh," It's a shame that the people who really need to see Matthew Akers' transfixing debut documentary, Marina Abramović: The Artist is Present, won't go near it."
rotten," In the end, though, this is still a movie about giant robots fighting each other, which is to say it's nearly impossible to take seriously on a narrative level."
fresh, A splendid film about a movie crew blindsided by the real world.
rotten, In a smarter comedy Cannon could do damage. But the jokes in Underclassman are so utterly defanged so throwaway they're the edgy equivalent of suburban doctor's office banter.
fresh, The tale rises or sinks to a level of horror with an unimaginable brutality that no doubt Saw 8 or 9 will pilfer.
rotten, A graceless info-dump bracketed by interviews with activists and a handful of personal stories from suffering families around the country.
fresh," Hereditary reaps a cheap sort of reward. It's good, but really only just good enough."
rotten," Clint Eastwood misses the target, again, with laboured, sombre drama. "
rotten," Charming and harmless, except for the gaping hole where its two leads' romantic attraction is meant to be."
rotten," A shamelessly dull, difficult-to-grasp foray into not the dark but the dim."
fresh," Moon has heart, brains and a sense of humor, not to mention some nifty model-based special effects ... and a blockbuster performance by Sam Rockwell..."
fresh," This gritty little western subverts expectations at every possible turn and turns out to be a funny, twisted take on the tall tales of the American id."
rotten," A mostly silly slab of horror with a cast of beautifully groomed American youths, which makes it look strikingly like High School Musical, only with screaming."
rotten," it has the feeling of something vital and yet incomplete, as though greatness was swung for but solidly missed"
fresh," Sometimes, the sun shines and the wind blows fresh and the very elements that make for intense hardship also open a window on intense joy."
fresh," Not the freshest formula, you say? Perhaps, but it's hard to argue with success."
fresh," Almost by definition, documentaries about Iraq are gut-wrenching reminders of the unaccomplished mission. Body of War transcends even that tough standard."
fresh, Neighbors is a surprise and a delight.
rotten," Shouldn't a sci-fi love story like The Space Between Us have a little, you know, brains behind it?"
fresh," 'The Avengers"" is neither overwhelming nor underwhelming. What it expertly is, is whelming."
rotten," [It's] a rather inert, counterproductive way to tell a story, and results in a decidedly middling slice of genre cinema. "
rotten," ...disjointed, silly, and sloppy."
rotten, It's one of the most insane things to grace multiplex screens in years; it's also one of the most ludicrous.
rotten," herky-jerky from beginning to end... an increasingly tiresome string of sight gags about men groping other men, punching each other in the crotch and practicing silly routines."
fresh, The stars invest the characters with a quiet dignity but a melodramatic final scene seems out of place in this otherwise low-key film.
rotten, Rarely has such a talented comedian been so wildly out of touch with what's funny.
fresh," The beautifully animated Long Way North has an attention to detail visually that evens out some clichés, making it a must-watch for families with young girls."
rotten," Ferrell, in need of a shorter leash, never makes the character any more than a caricature, and Kidman, in a rare comedic role, suffers, too."
fresh, Charming and stirring.
fresh, Ralph Nader gives and he takes away.
fresh, Ang Lee and screenwriter David Magee managed to take Yann Martel's novel about a young boy and a tiger lost at sea and make it sing visually and narratively.
fresh," It's a beautifully made film about a young man's journey of self-discovery, about how Miguel ""Sugar"" Santos makes his way in the world and tries to figure out, as we all do, who he is meant to be."
fresh," This amiable oddball comedy should push things further, but it nevertheless earns a steady stream of laughs."
rotten," I haven't read McEwan's book, but now that I've seen the film I want to. Because the film doesn't quite add up, though scripted by the author."
rotten, has so much potential but winds up being instantly disposable thanks to some truly bizarre artistic choices that are bound to alienate about 90% of the audience 
rotten, How could reteaming Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper go wrong? In a word - Serena.
rotten," ... this film is satisfied merely to wallow in women in peril, cinematic sadism and the spectacle of violent death and dismemberment."
rotten," In the D-grade disaster movie Geostorm, meteorology has turned malicious."
rotten," Part human drama, part mystery, and part technical babble about viral mutations, and, with that wide breadth of concentration, each element falls short."
rotten," Dark Star gives us the world of H.R. Giger at its most intimate, yet fails to make use of the access to ask any questions or gain any insight to the late, groundbreaking artist. Giger is an enigma that this film seems determined to remain an enigma"
fresh," the ride outweighs the abrupt, mechanical end"
rotten, More of a missed opportunity than a movie.
rotten," Based on Isaac Asimov's short story collection and directed by Alex Proyas, who did much better with 'Dark City' and 'The Crow.'"
fresh, Le Livre d'Image is a film that derails itself constantly and self-consciously.
rotten, Strained and obvious political comedy that wastes some really great actors.
rotten, No one even gets dragged across concrete.
rotten," Intolerable Cruelty is a shallow and instantly forgettable non-romantic comedy, a new cinematic low point for Joel and Ethan Coen."
fresh, Craven sends the audience out feeling happy and inspired--which is the very reason why one would buy a ticket.
rotten," Only on screen for a few moments, Anjelica Huston provides the most moving experience in this odd, self-indulgent film about oddness and self-indulgence."
rotten, So bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled Generic Jennifer Lopez Romantic Comedy.
rotten, There's a fine line between the frenetic fun to be found in returning to a familiar roller-coaster ride and the dead-end slog of a dying franchise.
rotten, It's impossible to recommend Apollo 18 to anyone but the most staunch found-footage fans. The film fails every requirement of a tense and enjoyable time at the theater.
rotten," It's definitely good, definitely a little bit boring."
fresh, I loved the film more this time than I had the first time I watched it.
rotten, It's a summer blockbuster wannabe that opened in January instead to recoup the piece of its $70 million budget that it can. The film self-professes its primary character as a legend without making him feel like one.
rotten," A rare misstep for director David O. Russell. There are good things about it, but not enough to make it worth your time."
fresh," The Skeleton Twins is just another little bittersweet indie dramedy, and it's not a perfect film. But it is worth your time."
fresh, May I introduce a new phrase into the Franglais dictionary? C'était un slam-dunk.
fresh, The finest Disney feature-length animated musical ever made
rotten," Too awkward, disjointed and bland while lacking dramatic momentum and true insight."
rotten," It hopes that if it throws enough pop-cultural references at us, we won't notice how frantically it's trying to figure out what to do."
fresh," Go on, give in to temptation."
fresh, This inventive superhero movie hybrid (The Incredibles meet the X-men via Harry Potter) is one of the most entertaining family films of the summer.
rotten, A messy film with a contrived ending.
fresh," A brilliantly acted and bittersweet Chekhovian drama about family, art, memory, globalization and impermanence."
fresh," It's a brave way to structure a film, and the sentimental side gradually undercuts the laughs until all that's left is a vague warm feeling towards a character we'd flee from in real life."
fresh, Relies on a mounting atmosphere of slow-burn intensity and an attention to people rather than plot points.
fresh," Belgium's best-kept secrets are breaking through without selling out, and their unshowily inspiring domestic drama reminds us you don't need to go to war - or prison - to earn redemption."
rotten," If you're the type of person that thinks horror sequels are a bad idea, Sinister 2 is not the movie to make you change your mind. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten, A film that ends up being complacent for women who are in the same situation as the protagonist. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten," Big, fat, fluffy flakes of snow fall relentlessly in Love the Coopers, but little seems to accumulate."
fresh, Utimately it is the look of the film that makes an indelible impression.
rotten," Bright plays like the kind of movie a kid might make up (""And then this happens! And then this happens!"") if they were given a very rough overview of American history and then told to write a script about it."
rotten," Like the music, the filmmaking habitually meanders."
rotten, Unimaginative shocker.
rotten," There's plenty of manly weeping onscreen when the decepticons start executing captured autobots, but as far as I could tell, there wasn't a damp eye in the theatre. "
rotten, ... retains only a fraction of the crude charm and offbeat originality of its predecessor.
rotten," A lowered set of expectations will be required, however, lest you fall into its often dull diversions"
fresh, Perhaps only by reading the book after you've seen this is the skill of Stillman's treatment to be fully grasped - it's one of the deftest feats of literary interpolation in ages.
rotten, The most horrifying depiction of inhuman behavior since That's My Boy. Or maybe Jack & Jill. Or maybe Blue Velvet.
rotten, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance nudges its obscure hero's mythology forward a bit without seeming to care much how it gets there.
rotten," The longer the film goes on, the more it becomes apparent that there's barely enough substance here to support an Aesop's fable, let alone a Los Angeles crime epic."
fresh," Home foreclosure meets hooker hell in The Client List, yet another entry into that ever expanding genre of recession blues cinema. While Cybill Shepherd doing Mae West with a string of raunchy one-liners, just about steals the show from Hewitt."
rotten," Lugubrious, bumbling and sit-com predictable, Our Idiot Brother has a couple of good ideas, no style, an episodic structure and some charming incidental pleasures, not the least of which are the performances, which are good."
rotten, The film is less than 80 minutes and if you cut the shots that go on too long it would be less than an hour.
rotten," This film is chaos on wheels. Nothing really makes sense, the action is filmed in a way that is totally confusing. It's impressionistic cinema. Co-writer/director Joe Carnahan seems to think that what we can't figure out won't hurt us."
fresh," Stephanie is an ambitious, deliberately ambiguous story which wrenches the viewer by the collar and refuses to let go from the first frame to the last."
rotten, Good idea unsuccessfully realised with Ed Burns doing his best.
rotten," For an idea of how little Norm of the North can do with its material, consider a scene where a polar bear visits a high-end sushi restaurant. And then watch it go nowhere, like an ice floe broken adrift. Kind of like the whole movie."
rotten," This is the worst yet from Michael Bay's horror production company Platinum Dunes, which also brought you rubbish re-makes of Halloween and Friday the 13th."
fresh, The film is surface-shallow - but only because the culture it reflects is arguably too superficial to withstand any kind of analysis.
fresh, Fruitvale Station nos lembra de que somos todos Oscar Grant.
fresh," Everything comes together beautifully to craft a whirlwind portrait that's mischievous, smart, and substantial."
fresh," Smith is again playing a hustler and shows his familiar charm and charisma. The film itself plays like an ersatz version of one of David Mamet's dramas in which everybody is cheating everybody else, but it suffers from a lack of plausibility."
rotten," The story, partly inspired by the bobsled comedy Cool Runnings, goes nowhere imaginative or risky, and the characters don't transcend their initial cartoonishness."
rotten, Raman Hui's Monster Hunt is a kid-friendly adventure fantasy that may be too slowly paced for its target demographic.
rotten, It never adds up to more than a curiosity for opera fans.
fresh," Hell or Highwater is a splendid contemporary western. Dramatic, sensitive and humane. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten," A sufficient conclusion to the series Singer started, but any connection these films had to the original comics has faded away."
rotten, Pure Disney in the goofy early-60's sense.
fresh," It celebrates the gothic outsider in familiar fashion, though it does so with a wisdom and gentleness that Burton seems to have lost."
rotten," While [Gibson's] portrayal of Doss' heroism on the battlefield is moving and honorable, neither the tedious setup nor the ham-fisted delivery should get a free pass."
rotten," It's somewhat better put together than Saw II or III, though there isn't a scare in it."
rotten, I saw it so you wouldn't have to. Give Replicas a miss.
fresh," A startling history lesson in the history Germany wanted, very much, to forget. "
fresh," Doctor Strange might have a lot of baggage, but more than anything else, it's fun."
rotten," The emotional oomph of the original is stripped away in this sanitized version of the story of a woman caught in the web of violence of drug cartel. Gina Rodriguez is good, but for naught"
fresh," If you don't like this movie, you may have a pulse, but you've got no heart."
fresh, A perfect illustration of Freud's links between jokes and the unconscious-or just why it sucks to go home-Kris Avedisian's debut feature is essential post-holiday viewing.
fresh," Fans of ""Pitch Black"" are likely to find this new film a worthy successor, those who have never seen the first film will be able to jump right into the story and follow along."
rotten, Leather and swords and British accents and gorgeous guys wielding them all can make a gal overlook a lot of badness in a flick. But not quite this much.
fresh, ...the movie possesses an unusually bright and colorful sense of style that immediately sets it apart from its increasingly plentiful brethren.
fresh," Brawl in Cell Block 99 is a requiem for the workingman, brilliantly crafted and suitably savage."
rotten," Like its ten-foot anti-heroes, 'Warcraft' is noisy, lumbering and not terribly bright. "
rotten," Every time the movie threatens to get interesting, one of its hordes of ersatz, non-animated characters shows up and starts talking again."
rotten," ""Palo Alto"" feels earnest and promising, but half-formed."
rotten, The fact that [Collette's] performance was once the talk of a possible Oscar nomination is funnier than anything in the film.
fresh," A grand, unworldly, even antiworldly religious vision that depends on its perfect pitch to avoid absurdity and bathos."
rotten, The movie is amusing and clever but only skin deep.
rotten, An underwhelming telling of the story of the couple behind the 1967 Supreme Court case that legalized interracial marriages.
fresh, A remarkable episode in the bloody history of what is still referred to -- with increasingly sickening irony -- as 'the war to end all wars.'
fresh," Part wacky comedy (with plenty of jailhouse humping), part existential allegory, Pound betrays its stage-play roots with too much actorly grandstanding but is peppered with ecstatic funk-powered freak-outs."
fresh," A dreamy but strikingly immediate and frayed-at-the-edges, child's-eye view of life on the margins of America."
rotten, There aren't enough adrenalin moments to supercharge a film that gets bogged down in exposition.
fresh, Director Robin Swicord introduces just enough hustle and bustle to demonstrate that the romantic joys and negotiations found in Austen's plots can survive in any era or setting.
fresh," When it comes to Away from Her, the overused, abused adjective cannot be avoided: it is a great film."
rotten," An insult to the viewer's intelligence, which sticks to silly slapstick while failing to get around to making a mature statement about relationships."
fresh," The film celebrates stupidity and would likely have caused an international incident if Canadians weren't so nice, but it essentially lives up to its premise, once in a while coming up with a gag that is halfway funny."
rotten," I can't speak for Richelle Mead's novels, but I'm assuming they read like the instruction manuals for a role playing game: there are both too many, and not enough, rules."
rotten," When a celebrity chef like Rodriguez is just going through the motions, we can smell that the grindhouse fad is way past its expiration date. It's time to put a fork in it."
rotten," These were bad songs then, and they are worse songs now; the film's fatal flaw is that it never decides how it feels about that fact, or how to deal with it."
fresh," Accompanying adults may notice that the plotting could be tighter and the animation could be more sophisticated, but at 87 minutes, Blinky at least knows when to say ""Hooroo""."
rotten, A failed script and poorly executed action sequences make for a forgettable movie. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh," It's unique: a sci-fi feature wherein most of the exploration is done within the human soul, a kind of obverse of what we usually expect from the genre."
rotten, Dramatically undercooked and shot in a way that makes the whole thing feel random and amateurish.
rotten," You could look at this as Arnold doing her job well -- after all, her source material isn't exactly a party -- but it's so bleak that it ends up being a little too hard to watch."
rotten," The cartoonish characters may seem endearing at first, but their idiosyncrasies soon become tiresome and all humor is lost. "
rotten," Se maneja en el filo entre la comedia absurda y el drama lacrimógeno, una combinación no siempre efectiva. Dentro de un buen elenco se destaca el intento de Mel Gibson por volver a los primeros planos."
rotten," Somewhere along the way, around that sixty-minute mark, the wheel comes off an already-wobbly wagon. "
rotten," A few individual moments crackle, but it's ultimately disappointing to see an artist as unique as Ramsay wrestling with something so familiar."
rotten," In overselling his movie's supposed intelligence, Besson just makes it look even stupider."
fresh," Will Reiser's semiautobiographical script initially prescribes too artificial a story treatment for its characters but is rescued by a genial, low-key vibe that builds in sensitivity and emotion up through the final reels."
fresh, Van Sant's design poignantly messes with the viewer's mind
rotten," Neeson's soft-spoken Angry Dad routine has been flattened into burlesque, giving him little to do but alternate between bumbling dork and efficient killer. "
fresh," Cynical, unconventional and edgy - it's horrifying and absurdly hilarious."
rotten, Is this a sex comedy or an episode of 'I Love the '90s'?
fresh, Marcin Wrona's Demon is spooky fun that unexpectedly mines the same collective guilt that powered Pawel Pawlikowski's brilliant historical drama Ida.
fresh," Nothing beats the 1968 original, but this third sci-fi reboot holds up as second best in the series."
rotten," There are explosions lighting the night sky, but otherwise it illuminates nothing. I couldn't even figure out what it might be trying to illuminate, or even if it was trying to illuminate anything at all."
rotten," ""Tammy"" is a bummer, not least because McCarthy's fans know she's better than this."
fresh, Its lack of sentimentality and melodrama is what elevates this thriller to another level.
rotten," While these orgies of violence are staged with tense, gruesome precision, they don't convey much beyond what we already know. Namely, that war is hell. Message received."
rotten," Outside of a couple of moments of self-conscious shock humor, the most surprising thing about the film is how square it really is."
rotten," claims to be 'inspired by true events'; the movie does not, however, specify the planet on which these events allegedly took place. ... a perfect companion piece to last year's dim-witted 'Stick It'..."
fresh," The film runs to more than two and a quarter hours, yet the pacing seldom flags."
rotten," It has the odd moment but without the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Danny Glover or Adrien Brody the cast feels distinctly under-powered."
fresh, Fear is the American vice ... Take Shelter latches on to something deep and true within many of us.
rotten, You can tell Pacino is committed to the role because he hasn't washed his hair.
rotten, The first Human Centipede had audacity on its side. Human Centipede II has only excess.
fresh," For those who elect to ride out the booze-soaked, forked-tongued storm, they receive a startlingly alert, good-natured, borderline poignant slapstick comedy that makes the most out of a one-joke premise."
rotten," Gondry invites us to rewind to a time before corporate domination, while failing to realize that 'corporate' and 'professional' are not synonyms."
rotten," Lovers of Charlotte Bronte's classic will luxuriate in the spooky Gothic atmosphere, but the film's pallid Jane fails to nail a character who changed how women view themselves."
rotten," would be too easy to make a pun out of the title ""The Brothers Grimm,"" because its a fair description of the atmosphere of the film itself. "
fresh, A tender love story that's deeply cinematic and builds to a heart-swelling conclusion free of sentimentality.
fresh," It's fun, but it's too busy, too eager to amaze ... [unlike] Pixar's films, which are supported by patient character development and storytelling that moves us."
rotten," God's Not Dead: A Light in Darkness isn't just the conclusion of the most successful film trilogy made for the evangelical market, it's the first time a Facebook argument has metastasized into a movie."
rotten," Some fans will be pleased, others annoyed and endless online discussion will be generated, while X virgins will most likely wonder what all the fuss is about."
fresh," Genuinely striking and unnerving, the film manages to ramp up the fright factor to such overly intense levels that uneasy laughter provides the only release."
rotten," If ever there was a movie that needed a strong finish, it's Ang Lee's ""Hulk,"" a film whose interminable first hour is such a bore, audiences might need their own nanomeds gamma rayed to get through it."
rotten," As a whole, it's not so much stupid as it is boring."
rotten, Chances are That's My Boy isn't a contemptuous stunt to see what Sandler can get away with and what audiences will accept; it just seems like one.
fresh," While Cash and Carter's music gives the movie its undeniable soundtrack, it's their thwarted yet constant tale of friendship and love that makes Walk the Line a big-movie pleasure."
rotten," Grotesque carnage, vile characters; steer clear."
fresh, Witherspoon carries Wild across the finish line
rotten, Anyone who still longs to see gaijin yahoos tear up Tokyo's streets will be appeased by the high-speed action in this perfunctory but reasonably efficient entry in the franchise spawned by the 2001 surprise hit The Fast and the Furious.
fresh, There is something different in Gibson's application of violence. The objections seem to lie not just in Gibson's realistic portrayal of cruelty but in the judgment he brings to it.
rotten," Disappointing thriller that's let down by a tedious script, a frankly ridiculous final act and some dodgy overacting by Kevin Spacey."
fresh," A characteristically colorful, poignant work full of exquisite compositions and dreamlike reflections that serves as an ideal encapsulation of the Vardian sensibility."
fresh, A get-under-your-skin makes no sense classic with some of the scariest images ever put on film.
fresh, An inspired gross-out horror pic.
rotten," Sadly, a couple of major plot twists take an already complicated plot and render it nearly incomprehensible, turning Inferno into a simple movie that is made complicated simply for the sake of being complicated."
fresh," An effective, comic road movie which doesn't quite dare to be as radical as its protagonists."
fresh," Murphy was the main reason I enjoyed Tower Heist so much; he's so fast, so jazzy, and so fluid, that he's a sheer joy to watch."
fresh," Lucas has made a deal with the devil, trading strong characterization and narrative for visual indulgence and verbal convolution."
rotten, One of those films that makes you feel bad when you exit the theater. 
fresh," A good film, ambitious and effective, introducing a gifted young actress and a director whose work I'll anticipate."
fresh, Anderson's lavish attention to visual detail supports the dry wit on display in a highly original animated film geared to appeal equally to adults and children.
rotten," The set up is so good that it pains me to say that the last half hour falls apart. Once things are revealed, it becomes too silly."
rotten, This movie has taken a firebrand book and turned it into a whingeing piece of defeatism.
fresh, Parts of the film are good and much of it has that quirky aura and charm that makes the Coen brothers' films so different from most everything else.
rotten," The man, so wonderful to listen to in his non-fiction films as he narrates away in his deliciously thick German accent, has a tin ear for English dialogue spoken by actors."
fresh," ... Lin must actually listen to criticism and has been slowly rectifying the mistakes made in his previous films - hell, the way he is going, by the time they get to Sweet Fast 16, it might be up for Best Picture."
rotten," Paper Heart is a cute movie, a little too cute and a little too aware of its own cuteness."
fresh," A pity that this film gets dragged by its convoluted plot, forcing emotion without deepening in any of its great subjects. Not even in love. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh," As a bio-pic, Factory Girl is limited, but as a snapshot of Sedgwick and Warhol's fiery relationship, there is much to fascinate us."
fresh, Funny Games is like a graduate thesis on screen violence. It's less successful as a compelling piece of cinema.
fresh," Hickson's largely silent performance is superb (in the kind of complex role not typically given to black actors in modern horror movies), never overselling his creeping madness. "
rotten, It is always a mistake for a movie to be more in love with its heroine than the audience is.
fresh," Elba grew up in Hackney, and also worked as a D.J., and his familiarity with the community is visible in the movie's evocation of a tumultuous world suffused with lowlife scheming and thumping tunes."
rotten, A groin-numbing onslaught of sexual-humiliation and emission-ingestion gags.
rotten," A hobbled-together mess, high on style and low on substance, while emotional potency clocks in two degrees above freezing."
rotten," It shows very clearly how far down the rabbit hole Hollywood has fallen. If it keeps making its heroes this horrible, it's heading for a major crash of its own."
fresh," ...a cheesy, drive-in B movie that's a helluva lot of fun, despite a tragic opening jolt and some seriously nonsensical plotting."
fresh," The SpongeBob Movie is essentially a kid-friendly stoner comedy, but also one that's clever and inspired enough to keep SpongeBob fans entertained."
fresh, ... Brigsby Bear is a delightful oddity about one weird guy's belated coming of age and the chintzy TV show that helps him grow up.
rotten," We are offered a handful of sketchy observations on the extent to which art either does or does not mimic life. These are, at best, unchallenging, and would have drawn barks of laughter from the derisive Flaubert."
fresh," It is done with skill and imagination, and overseen by a director, Robert Zemeckis, who knows the value of occasionally quietening things down for a bit of tension or a precisely timed joke."
fresh," Kore-eda raises his pet theme of judgment from subtext to text, while also contending with personal responsibility and the overall coldness of the universe"
rotten, This is fun because it's soo damn stupid.
rotten, This makes HANGOVER 2 look like HANGOVER 1.
rotten, Too bad The Crash lives up to its inauspicious name.
rotten," Without the interior monologues that gave the novel's characters more substance, it feels more like a perfume commercial than a story. "
fresh, a brilliant high tech treatment of the subject and the classified nature of the disclosures
rotten, wholly undignified.
fresh," It may take a little while to get there, but once it does it is worth taking this diabolically offbeat journey."
fresh," Exceptionally entertaining, but also keenly knowledgeable about music and the history and reverence behind it. Bandslam is more unadulterated fun than it has any right to be."
fresh," Overall, 13 Hours does rather showcase the good, the bad and the ugly of Michael Bay. But it's better elements just about outweigh its worst, making this a much better movie than a lot of people would have predicted."
fresh," A film where Gibson orchestrates a series of grandiloquent, violent and cruel combat sequences that help the viewer does not lose the rhythm of the story. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh," [Nicolas] Piercing proves that his stunning début was no mere flash in the pan, and though it's certainly not for everyone, this is a delicious piece of cinema."
rotten, Self-aware stupidity does not equal wit.
rotten," It will be a welcome relief to see Pattinson one day cast in a film not primarily targeted at women, or, indeed, one where he is forlorn and lovesick most of the time."
rotten, Conclusively proves that the Wachowskis had little substantial to add to the premise of the 1999 original.
rotten," An overtly melodramatic, televisual endeavour that harks back to classic b-movie thrillers of the 90s."
rotten, Slapstick comedy that really doesn't do anything new for the genre. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh," A fascinating nonfiction celebration of human curiosity and endeavor, Particle Fever gives viewers a shotgun-seat to history that plays out on a very relatable plane."
fresh," Eastwood directs and acts with remarkable restraint, skilfully getting far beneath the surface"
rotten," In a 102-minute film, Aaliyah gets at most 20 minutes of screen time. ... most viewers will wish there had been more of the ""Queen"" and less of the ""Damned."""
fresh," In many respects, Certified Copy is every bit as elliptical and provocative as more transparently ""experimental"" films."
rotten," By any objective standard, Feast isn't a good movie, but by those of its low-rent genre it's kind of fun."
fresh," Steven Spielberg's ""War Horse"" is an imperfect film, but certainly is a beautiful one."
rotten," ""The Words"" is a decent, ambitious, unoriginal film about a decent, ambitious, unoriginal writer. Both aim for greatness. Both fall short."
rotten," Too many realms, not enough nutcracker."
fresh," The title promises a concert movie, in 3-D, based on the show Glee, and the film delivers precisely that, in a way that I believe is sure to overjoy fans of the show. "
fresh, Thoroughly well scripted and well-acted. May be the greatest work to date from one of the greatest directors working.
rotten, There are not only glancing moments but whole sequences in this movie when the agony of social embarrassment makes you want to haul the characters to their feet and slap them in the chops.
rotten," When the plot feels like you've seen it three times before, and done better on each of those occasions, the movie better have something else going for it. Identity Thief doesn't."
fresh," The monologues are chilling, but too many subplots interfere with them."
fresh, Ondrej Vetchý is impressive as the stoic Franta.
fresh," An intriguing premise, sharp casting and thoughtful world-building make ""Divergent"" an engrossing science-fiction adventure."
fresh," Rude and crude, Tropic Thunder displays minimal mercy toward its targets, yet even its gross-out gags (watch out for those false teeth!) display a manic ingenuity far removed from the one-note coarseness found in your typical Will Ferrell vehicle."
fresh, It's a good deal more interesting than your average mainstream comedy.
rotten," ""This is a true story,"" Bay announces at the beginning of this misbegotten misfire. You know, because more responsible wording like ""based on"" is strictly for wusses."
fresh," A classic story competently told, Thérèse Desqueyroux is chocolate-box heritage cinema at heart, but a perfectly respectable and emphatically French epitaph to Miller's long career."
fresh," The premise is absurd to the max, but Payne delivers a comedy for those who enjoy contemplating bigger themes behind the laughs along with an ending that is aptly sublime."
fresh," Predictably, it's just as great as the first two."
fresh," From the interior of Binoche, is where the beautiful light comes from (whitish, like a beautiful autumn day) to which the title refers and which, at the same time, is what actually illuminates this charming film by Denis. [Full Review in Spanish]"
fresh," Despite its faults, Gangs excels in spectacle and pacing."
rotten," With this movie, Hollywood seems more intent than ever on disproving Tolstoy: Each unhappy family is unhappy in exactly the same way."
rotten, [Burning's] biggest issue here is that it needs two hours to tell its story. [Full Review in Spanish]
fresh," This is one of the best fantasy-type movies in years, not counting the Lord of the Rings"
fresh, A film that refuses to be an outcome plagued by meaningless action. As a war film is brutal thanks to its depressing images. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh," The vocal work is so finely honed by the cast of regulars, that the acting conveys a timing and skill rarely encountered in even the best live-action comedies."
fresh, Lincoln's flaws don't keep it from succeeding on several levels: as a showcase for Daniel Day-Lewis; and as an uncomfortable and pointed reminder about the hideous racism that's an unavoidable piece of America's makeup. 
fresh," Terrific, deeply affecting rock documentary that captures the unlikely assemblage of a bunch of L.A. black guys playing the kind of music no one had ever really heard before."
rotten," OK, Letters from Iwo Jima it's not. Firehouse Dog, though, serves a purpose, and it's a purpose you'd know quite well if you had a 6-year-old."
fresh," The dialogue is spare, spans of silence run for minutes, the tense atmosphere is punctuated by unexpected eruptions of violence, and the film does not end happily for anyone."
fresh, Often fascinating and provocative.
fresh, A refreshing reminder in the age of the Bourne movies that spies are real people leading everyday lives. 
fresh," You want an audience to care about the fate of the protagonist, no matter what the situation? Cast Tom Hanks. You want a young actress who can suggest fierce intelligence and conviction? Cast Felicity Jones."
fresh," Is it as good as the first two films? No. But because of the formula there are still pleasures to be had, and director Howard does a good job of integrating the medieval images and keeping viewers off-balance."
rotten," Nolte sounds like a muppet now, and the film itself isn't very engaging."
rotten, One of the weaker Lang films.
rotten," (Daddy's Home 2 is) destined for an after-life as an annual Christmas re-run you'll tune in to by accident, only to end up changing the channel or just going to bed."
rotten," Engineered from the minutes of a sequel committee who wanted to fuse Frozen and Braveheart into a package that would delight the four quadrants of the audience, that's men, women, children and body fascists. "
fresh," All the same, this isn't a patch on the phantsamagoric splendour of Pan's Labyrinth, over-egging every set-piece and outstaying its welcome by at least half an hour."
rotten," Most action movies these days forgo the script in favor of slam-bang visuals and stunts, but Basic actually suffers from too much plot."
fresh," The performances transcend the film's tropes, grounding it in characters that feel more complete than this subgenre often produces."
fresh, The Bonnie and Clyde formula gets a healthy dose of laughing gas with this hilarious and apropos slice of social commentary.
fresh," Utterly preposterous, but this car-crazy franchise is armor-plated."
fresh," The director's slovenliness is a torture device of its own, but the grueling point is well taken"
fresh, It's so good in every respect that it really doesn't need the plot alone to keep me engaged avidly.
rotten, The audience will Abandon their seats.
rotten, One of Hollywood's moldy oldies -- brothers on opposite sides of the law -- gets yet another spin in this lead-footed crime drama by James Gray.
fresh," A quietly stirring, beautiful little movie shot in black and white, it hasn't aged a microsecond."
rotten," If the best thing about a spy movie is the wallpaper, perhaps you've miscalculated."
fresh," By its climax of sorts, it's clear the film may be a goof on Rodrigues' part, but good thing it's at least funny enough to not just sustain, but build its laughs to the very end."
fresh," Yates and Kloves find the grand scope in Rowling's book, and mine it for all the excitement and pathos it's worth."
rotten," Too sentimental for art house crowds and too dirty for multiplex folk, The Good Heart is a movie without an audience about characters that never feel like they really exist."
fresh," The glossy style and neat visual effects combine with a few genuinely creepy moments to make this above-average genre fare, though the full-on sorcery showdown belongs in another movie."
rotten," a nice, redemptive romantic comedy with a lot of F-bombs in it, which by Hollywood standards makes it pretty much routine"
rotten," Maybe it would have worked better if it was all animated, all live-action or by turning Frank into a cartoon charter and the City of Frank into the live-action portion."
rotten," The movie's impersonal, conventional telling of a reasonably standard male coming-of-age story almost tends to make the punk milieu it depicts beside the point."
fresh," The D Train is an original take on the clichéd reunion story we've seen so many times before, but it's not for the faint of heart. This is an intelligent, dark comedy with a hard R rating. "
rotten," A moodily grim, choppily edited potboiler with a howlingly ludicrous ending...The sheer luridness of 'Dark Places' may hold your attention, but by the close the goofy plot twists and laughable motivations will probably induce a few snickers."
fresh," It's an intriguing and ambitious science-fiction entry that, despite its flaws, still manages to serve up a pleasing family-friendly movie-going experience."
fresh," An intriguingly endearing kooky fest of witty dialogue that has no clear plan of where is wants to end up, short of a musical number to smooth over all grievances and differences."
fresh," An outrageous and uncompromising assault on capitalism, consumerism, racism and other unpleasant -isms that have come to define these United States of America."
fresh, Thor: Ragnarock is a party and everyone is invited. [Full Review in Spanish] 
rotten," The good intentions are obvious, but a bit more crunch is sorely needed."
fresh, It's horrifying on many levels-and yet there's something deeply admirable about it.
rotten," Ultimately fails because it can't handle its jarring tonal shifts. That, and the majority of the plot elements are complete failures . (Splice Today)"
rotten," Am I the only one wondering why ""Monster House"" wasn't released at Halloween?"
rotten," ""I've never seen such energy!"" gushes Stone of his new best friend, setting the tone for a film as ""fair and balanced"" as the right-wing media it so roundly castigates."
rotten," Like Taylor Swift's pop hit ""Love Story,"" Garry Winick's Letters to Juliet references Shakespeare to prop up its cornball fairy-tale romanticism."
rotten," Everybody is I think is good in the film, except Tom Cruise."
fresh," Mostly, the movie keeps things on the near side of fun, and pushes a not-entirely-insipid life perspective. The ratio of staggering craft to innocuous content brings this to a level of better-than-average-contemporary children's fare."
rotten, 31 years after the last film in the series was released... comes the fifth proposal with the same simple comic recipe as in its previous iterations. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten, An excellent first performance can't balance naïve writing and direction
rotten," The uneven tones, basic plot, and unnecessary villains left me dissatisfied with The Good Dinosaur."
rotten, An earnest biopic that misses the ball. 
rotten," The biggest disappointment, among many, for Greengrass's reboot of the franchise he and Damon had abandoned for a decade is how divorced Bourne is from his original species."
fresh, There are several blisteringly powerful scenes which lend the picture's message of understanding and unity a weight and authority.
fresh," Has the earnest, wonky charm of a homemade valentine."
fresh," A powerful, rapturous viewing experience that strikes the delicate balance between Shakespeare's iconic iambic pentameter and ultra-modern [storytelling]."
fresh, Watch the film if you're an Aishwarya Rai fan.
rotten, An explicit shot of a penguin doing its business on a man's face [is] an apt metaphor for what the movie has to offer family audiences.
rotten, The charm and humor they brought in tiny doses in the previous films now comes in a massive blast that wears thin quickly.
fresh, Miracle at St. Anna is a real revelation. It is also not a perfect film.
fresh," Unlike Jack Nicholson and James Caan, who also played troubled novelists in King-inspired films, John Cusack gives an utterly sympathetic and likable performance that puts us on his side in a flick that makes a virtue of being old-fashioned horror."
fresh," Cannon is a good actor; he's exceptionally funny and has a great sense of timing. Stil, toning down some of the over-the-top elements in 'Underclassman' would've helped."
fresh, No other director could maintain this degree of optimism while telling such a superficially grim story. 
rotten," Mostly, the movie gives the impression of serving as the opening salvo in a larger corporate enterprise. And while its leading man might be gigantic, in qualitative terms, Kong doesn't set the bar very high."
rotten," The script is packed with witty touches, but nothing can divert attention from the predictability of the story."
rotten," A pretty preposterous plotline, but who am I to argue with a tale presumably based on a true story?"
rotten, The film is elephantine and pretentious without being in the least bit significant.
fresh," Gameau ... inserts a bit of journalism into the mix with two road trips that elevate ""That Sugar Film"" beyond a semi-vanity production."
rotten," Though the film hardly ends the series on a triumphant note, it still qualifies as one of the better entries."
rotten," The film's tagline tells us that this is the greatest escape adventure ever told. While that may indeed be true, the movie that tells the story certainly never achieves the same heights."
fresh, It is more a character study than a superhero adventure. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh, It's almost as though the film itself has gone self-aware and wants to jump ahead into its own meta-readings about how Bradley Cooper turned Lady Gaga into a movie star
fresh, Beautifully crafted.
rotten, ...holds the dubious distinction of being the laziest stage-to-screen transfer I've ever seen.
rotten," What better way to celebrate Chinese new year than with this film? Erm ... actually, there are a number of activities that might be better."
rotten," A[n]... ice-skating obsessive might find something praiseworthy in all this predictable, ham-fisted, romantic tosh."
rotten," Desperate and dreary, The Pink Panther 2 is an empty-souled star vehicle that hasn't a clue what actual wit and comic timing entail."
fresh, This so-called hockey thug is actually a nice guy and I found myself rooting for him to knock those other players out. This film is based on a true story.
rotten, Cloying and contrived.
fresh," ""Best of Enemies"" makes a strong case that the Vidal-Buckley debates were a sort of gateway drug that led to our insatiable craving for the sort of all-heat, no-light exchanges that form the backbone of today's 24-hour cable news universe."
fresh," Each performance is beautifully controlled, notably Huppert's devastating comic turn as Augustine, and integrated into a seamless ensemble."
fresh," What's astonishing about the film is its hypnotic seamlessness - the way that the director, Alfonso Cuarón, using special effects (and 3D) with a nearly poetic simplicity and command, places us right up there in space along with the people on screen."
fresh, It's completely satisfying on the level of an FX-driven summer blockbuster. But most importantly it's satisfying on the level of a great drama.
fresh," ""The American"" is minimalist movie-making at its best. "
fresh," For 2010, Tangled is on top of my list of broadly entertaining movies that should please most people. Tangled is clever and enchanting, with animated characters who have heart and soul."
rotten," A sci-fi snoozer that will remind one of another such pretentious dud, Solaris, Steven Soderbergh's 2002 fiasco starring George Clooney."
rotten," It's mediocre, middle of the road boring where the finely decorated house ends up more interesting than the characters residing in it. (Full Content Review for Parents - Profanity, Sexual Content, etc. - also Available)"
fresh, Every Little Step is on firmer ground with the 2006 revival; the filmmakers' great coup was winning the right ..to film the audition process.
rotten," I'd like to report that The Curious Case of Benjamin Button represents the end of an era, one of those turning-points when American movies just have to change because they can't get any worse. "
rotten," In the end, the strengths of the movie are overwhelmed by what is pretentious, unplugged and boring to boot."
rotten, Lucas is a toymaker and merchandising mogul who has long since lost the human touch.
rotten, Can someone please put this inane car-chase thriller back on the shelf?
fresh, I enjoyed it as a companion piece to the superior original...
rotten," An execrable waste cooked up by a hell's kitchen of directors and writers. It's death-of-laughter by committee. Its title? Because it's like one of those many asteroids out there--a dismal chunk of rock hurtling through an empty void, without purpose."
fresh," Though it would have benefited from a more detached approach, this is a vital look at a subculture that remains foreign to many New Yorkers -- despite its growing influence over all our lives."
fresh," A feature film that's often astringent on the surface, yet deeply and memorably stirring."
fresh, [Weitz] wrings out solid humor from Portia's comic struggles to balance her professionalism with her newly unearthed maternal instincts.
fresh, It will leave you breathless.
rotten," Partisan is too obscure to appeal even to American arthouse crowds. It's too obscure and uneventful, ultimately, for its own good."
fresh," The actors' convincing portrayals and realistic bond with each other, along with the spectacular visual and sound effects created by Lucas, makes Red Tails feel genuine and powerful."
fresh," ... ""Paddington 2"" is a total delight."
rotten, Some sick moves get even sicker; some become distorted and freakishly distracting.
rotten, Bloated epic that ranks in the bottom half of Kurosawa's magnificent body of work.
fresh," a giddy, grin-producing guilty pleasure"
rotten," Speed cost something like $30 million; this sequel cost four times as much. So why is it such a feeble, aimless piece of junk in comparison?"
rotten," As much as I like Hilary Duff and Lizzie McGuire, they both deserved better than this underwhelming big screen outing."
fresh," What is startling here is the eye-popping colour, the self-reflexive photography and visual effects, the dance sequences (Fred Astaire with his umbrella), and the witty and ingenious use of the Paris locations."
rotten," Sadly, this film resides in no man's land. Too somber to be much fun, it's also too dumb to be fully engrossing."
rotten, Like a taxidermist's turkey: overstuffed and lifeless.
rotten, Guided by the principle that action movies have become generic that anybody can be plugged into the hero role and the results would be no different than if Arnold Schwarzenegger or Bruce Willis was the star.
rotten," Happy days for those who love this sort of thing. But Raimi's effort, perhaps because we hadn't seen the plot before, was infinitely more scary."
fresh," ""Lights Out"" adeptly weaves a web of tense, nightmarish situations undercut on occasion by blips in logic."
fresh," The script, based on memoirs of their experience by Wilson and Plame, has two stories to tell -- the run-up to Iraq, and the portrait of a marriage under fire -- and combines them very adroitly."
fresh," The Informant! says that people who do good or ill have complex motives for their actions, and that not everyone is knowable, instantly or ever."
fresh," A sociopathic killer and a damaged cop face off in this Indian thriller that does a surprisingly deep dive into lust, murder and violent obsession."
rotten," Can you understand the words that are comin' outta my mouth? This is racist, bullying garbage."
fresh, Don't call it a comeback. The Muppets never went away.
fresh," Why make a sequel? Well, why not: This one is more fun."
fresh, Arévalo offers up a mid-movie twist that essentially changes everything and paves the way for a second half rife with electrifying sequences. 
fresh," An extended anthropological discourse, a dissection of the dashed dreams and hopes of a counterculture destroying itself from within due to a misunderstood threat from without."
fresh," One of the three greatest food movies of all time, 1985's ""Tampopo"" arrives back in theaters in a 4K restoration and it is cause for celebration."
fresh," It's Watkins' lean, keen instinct for choreographing and cutting action set pieces that keeps ""Bastille Day"" afloat."
rotten," The ending, cryptic, meaningless and with the worst CGI of the entire film, buries it all and confirms any doubts; the film is a robbery that looks more interesting than it is. [Full Review in Spanish] "
rotten," Zellweger acquits herself rather well, although McConaughey's eye-rolling, over-the-top performance is a matter of personal taste."
fresh, Garland's alien biodome is a trippy mixture of tactile old school hardware and computer-generated images.
rotten, It's only when Ferrell and Wahlberg go head-to-head that The Other Guys sparkles and its unfortunate that such a good pairing is wasted.
rotten," Bardem tackles the juicy acting challenge of playing someone paralyzed from the neck down by... simply pasting an obnoxiously smug, serial killer-creepy grin on his mug."
fresh," The cultural time capsule doubles as a testament to the joys of outsiders bonding, with interviewees emphasizing how they finally felt like they belonged somewhere after years of asphyxiating alone on the fringe."
rotten," Actor/producer Union's motivation to make this discount home invasion thriller is clear, but it fails to equal (or elevate) her talents."
rotten," As exciting as clothing bought off the rack at K-Mart and less informative than even the weakest episode of ""Project Runway."""
rotten," Like everything else attractive to the eye in ""Damsel,"" this image of happiness is a cruel illusion. It's also an unilluminating one."
rotten," ""Evil"" fails to triumph. Utterly."
fresh," Achieves its ecstatic, giddy high because it is peopled by immensely likable, endearing characters, all led by the tireless Black, who could make even the staunchest country music fan believe that rock 'n' roll can, in fact, change the world."
fresh, ...a passable yet hopelessly bloated big-budget sequel (ie Wan is clearly not a big believer in the less-is-more concept).
fresh," Gripping, smart, well-acted - everything you want in a period drama."
rotten, Faris's Marilyn Monroe-inspired breathy delivery feels forced and gets old fast. Only the scene-stealing Emma Stone shows any promise.
rotten," Tyldum's picture, you see, is a prime example of how a promising story set in the wild starry yonder can crash and burn, even with some of the most likeable actors in the business."
fresh," Confidence may be mannered at times, but its shell-game plot is alive with organic trickery."
rotten," T. R. Baskin is never at a loss for words, most of which sound as if they had come straight from the notebook of a writer who spent most of time jotting down funny lines without ever worrying much about character."
fresh," The grand finale is a series of what appear to be single-take sequences of bone-breaking, bullet-blasting violence, almost all of it presented with a practical-effects, minimal-CGI approach bound to impress genre devotees."
rotten," The film is poorly scripted and built around a mirthless performance by Robert Gustafsson, a less-than-100-year-old actor whose face has undergone seeming vulcanisation."
rotten," The short film is a bright, forgettable throwaway, even though its anti-bullying message is timely."
fresh," Carell is his dependable wounded-puppy self, always likable, but Gosling and Stone are fantastic."
fresh," Despite a few stray moments that ring false, this is an intellectually engaging, emotionally satisfying drama. "
rotten, Neither Levinson nor Hoffman was able to penetrate the mystery of their subject.
fresh," It's not laugh-out-loud hysterical, but the ensemble -- Cross and the always-amusing Hayes in particular -- establishes a just-zany-enough rapport that's enjoyable rather than irritating."
fresh," An example of exceedingly efficient filmmaking and storytelling, getting the job done in a brisk 106 minutes even as the picture isn't really providing its prospective audience with anything particularly new."
rotten," The Case For Christ is pretty slow going, tedious rather than offensive."
fresh," A canny, well-wrought film that uses Argentina's checkered past to fashion a juicily rapt mixture of personal obsession, simmering romance and political skullduggery. "
rotten," The result is pacy, patchy and, at the last, plain old slapdash: if anyone can work out what the eventual villain did -- or why -- please let us know."
fresh," Cronenberg never strays from the big picture of a world not only comprised of destructive impulses, but designed to breed more of them."
fresh," Easily one of, if not the BEST Dragon Ball movie to date! "
rotten," Sam Raimi's film provides proof that the more we know about the mysteries of our favorite stories, the less interesting they become."
fresh," A furiously ambitious literary adaptation, the best of Wright and Knightley's careers, that tries to make us feel the intense sexuality and terror and grief of a classic novel ..."
rotten," For me, 3 Ninjas had its amusing moments but was also tedious at times."
fresh," ... a film which doesn't necessarily equate to its title in the early going. It should grow on you, however ..."
fresh," This surprisingly zingy, throwback studio comedy is witty and observant on the dynamics between couples."
fresh," May have been made on a tight budget, but one would never know it based on the striking production values director Jim Mickle manages in order to realize his harrowing vision."
fresh," Birth of the Living Dead does not uproot the order of behind-the-scenes documentaries, but the great likelihood that this film will send viewers right back to Romero's original with eyes reopened is a mark of its considerable success."
rotten," It boasts unpardonably terrible CGI, even worse green screen effects, and the maturity of a 12-year-old boy whose internet privileges have been revoked."
rotten, Shrek has been great fun. Now let's say goodbye and move on to some fresher ideas.
fresh," Despite some predictability in the portrait of political corruption, [McQueen] achieves several powerful and disturbing scenes, and sustains the route of intrigue in the solid performances. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten," As big-screen romances go, this is a far cry from An Affair To Remember. It's an affair you'll probably forget on the bus trip home. "
fresh, Mia Hansen-Løve's EDM movie memoir is the art-house party of the year.
rotten," An elaborately produced, mostly charmless adventure-comedy that intends to make fun of a kind of romantic fiction that's one step removed from what the movie is all about."
rotten," There's nothing particularly clever or interesting here, no plot element that requires stretching a 20-minute cartoon to 87 minutes on the screen."
fresh," As a group, these short films sing."
fresh, Genuine if not exactly inspiring.
fresh," Cobra is a sleek, extremely violent and exciting police thriller."
fresh," T2 Trainspotting won't leave you floating on air. But it will leave you with a smile on your face, a tear in your eye, and a trickle of its predecessor's old adrenaline coursing through your veins."
rotten," [An] overreaching, hypocritical mess."
rotten, An impersonal slice of television that feels out of place on the big screen.
rotten, struggles for commitment
fresh, Soul-stirring and acute in its diagnosis of how a well-established couple negotiates its own continued survival.
fresh," Ms. Akhavan shows promise as an assured director, a talented writer and an interesting actress."
rotten, Tze Chun's film exudes no flair in rehashing the violence and suspense of its predictable noir-thriller material.
rotten," For the majority of Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters, the titular character spends his time moping over the uncertainty of his heroism. "
fresh," Predictable but never coy about it, After Words speaks to the fateful connection that sometimes occurs between two people under the most improbable circumstances."
fresh, Coffee With D is a sketch for a television comedy that has unforgivably been stretched to 123 minutes.
fresh," There is fun to be found, but when is all said and done, the eyes may be sated, but the brain's still craving."
rotten," It's dumb, but it's fun, and it doesn't pretend to be otherwise."
fresh, The kind of film that is able to follow us. [Full Review in Spanish] 
rotten," Hollywood and its superhero franchises are all but coextensive, and Shyamalan's confrontation with the ubiquity, popularity, and dominance of superheroes gives ""Glass"" a second-level urgency."
fresh, I haven't had this much fun at the movies in a long time.
rotten," A romantic comedy doesn't have to be a hardcore slog through the crippling realities of love, but fantasy shouldn't feel like punishment. Who needs substance when the obvious is a proven seller."
rotten," Lots of hocus pocus but not much focus in Focus. Or, dare we say Focus is often out of focus? Either works. The movie does not. "
rotten," Shallow and conventional, Amelia, yet another version of the legendary aviatrix, is a total misfire, unfolding as a narrated photo album with plot that's all turning points but no real substance, fully fleshed characters or significant issues."
rotten," If you care about the material, you already saw it done earlier, and better, in the Gibney film."
rotten, The fledgling directors juggle a few too many balls and aren't quite up to the challenge.
fresh," Brutal and uncompromising, Mid90s packs more emotional punch than would be expected of a slacker skater movie. "
fresh," It's thrilling to see such an original, mature story seek to fill its big heart with poetry."
rotten, It's also so weighted down with mysticism and metaphor it forgets to quicken your pulse or whiten your knuckles.
rotten, Here's hoping Hardwicke can top this masterpiece with her inevitable adaptation of Jack Jumps Over the Candlestick.
rotten," Idle Hands is either idiotic or pandering, when it isn't both."
fresh," The movie's titled Bullet to the Head, what the heck do you think it's going to be?"
rotten," But the voyeurism that Kapadia managed to evade with Senna becomes inescapable in Amy, with the story having the added weakness of feeling warmed-over thanks to Winehouse's extensive media exposure while her travails were unfolding."
rotten," In its desire to counteract the image of the stuck-up Brit, the movie ends up wallowing in its own silliness."
fresh," What is, perhaps, surprising, is the way the film aligns our sympathies with the apes."
fresh," ""It's a Disaster"" wouldn't be a bad choice for the last movie you see before life on Earth comes to a crashing halt. "
fresh," Both lead actors are good, with Huller especially adept at depicting how mechanically Ines buries so much frustration, loneliness, anger and desire beneath her all-business exterior."
fresh," Nakata skilfully takes us into the real and virtual lives of a group of London teenagers and shows us, with terrifying consequences, the power and ability to manipulate reality in a virtual world."
rotten," Avoiding the pitfalls of The Da Vinci Code, the eventful follow-up makes plenty of its own mis-steps. We now have renewed respect for the corny, endearingly unpretentious National Treasure movies."
fresh," Among the 1990s' most fruitful marriages of high-brow auteurist style and pulp source material. A Burtonesque layer cake: at bottom, his take on German Expressionism; then the Gotham grotesquerie; topping it all off is a fissuring, fracturing fairytale."
fresh," Ranging from funny to shattering and featuring some of the year's best acting, Personal Velocity gathers plenty of dramatic momentum."
fresh," The light Frances Ha provides skittish moments of heartbreak and confusion on the humorous path to adulthood, but it sends a comforting message that our fate may use the same language as our dreams even if it doesn't tell the same story."
rotten," Whatever your expectations are for the unclassifiable The Book of Henry, I guarantee they won't be fully realized. "
fresh, A clever and bloody romp over the turf of friendship and fear.
fresh," Even if you have little interest in the world of figure skating, this is still an interesting look at a true pioneer whose innovations and influences can still be felt and recognized to this day."
rotten," Carell's performance is exaggerated, pronounced and so prominent that it obstructs other features."
rotten, Joshua Marston's inert and hyper-literal new drama suffers from a fatal identity crisis.
rotten," Wants to be dark, wants to be funny...winds up really being neither."
rotten, An historical romance cum love triangle that can't see the forest for the trees.
rotten, What begins as a pique to our collective curiosity quickly degenerates into what is essentially a shootout between the good guys and the monsters.
fresh," A Royal Romance, which premiered just six days before the big day, is precisely what you want it to be: juicy, romantic, and slightly ridiculous. It's really not a terrible way to spend two hours of your life."
rotten, We seem to be mentally preparing our youth - our young girls especially - for soldierly duties with these films. 
rotten," The sparkling blue waters are pretty, and the songs are catchy, but you may well wind up feeling smothered by the non-stop corniness of it all."
rotten," While a fish rots from its head down, a film suffers from the screenplay up -- which is where Sherlock Homes stinks."
rotten," The best thing to be said about this pedestrian, sedentary storyline is that it contains no bathroom humour. But since it also contains practically no humour at all, this isn't much of an endorsement."
fresh," While classical music sometimes seems to exist in a bubble protected from the real world, the people who play it struggle with the same issues everyone else does."
fresh, This would have been nothing without Theron.
fresh, ...easily the year's best comedy.
fresh," Nolan shows that his achievement in Memento was no fluke, although this time around he plays it safer"
rotten, Stephen Winter's film doesn't earn the gall it evinces by pissing on Shirley Clarke's masterpiece.
fresh," Just like its hero, the film is operatic and grandiose in places, shambling and inarticulate in others, but always intensely watchable."
rotten, There's a stink coming off the big-screen Dukes of Hazzard that even fans of the TV series (1979 to 1985) won't be able to shake out of their nostrils.
fresh, Brilliant performance by Paul Kaye.
fresh," This is a stark film, about the human condition at its most base and degraded."
fresh, The Shape of Water may just be his most touching fantasy yet.
fresh, Unique and visually stunning martial arts epic is set in the 14th-century Ming dynasty.
rotten," Carrey doesn't break off into outrageous physical comedy bits as fans might hope, and the film does take a while to find its legs, but there is something rewarding in its quirky demeanor."
rotten, Diane Keaton has a lot to answer for in her willingness to portray Hollywood's idea of middle-aged womanhood.
rotten," certainly reeks, but not with class. ... Director Ivory is too busy ogling the haute cuisine lunches and the Hermes scarves and red crocodile purses to pay much attention to such trivialities as plot development and tonal consistency."
fresh," Though Netzer's compassion for both Ana and Toma is never in doubt, the fragmentation of the narrative ensures a measure of detachment which makes for balance, ambivalence and clarity."
rotten, Prepubescent homoeroticism and loveable pederasty highlight this preposterous and pointless provocation.
rotten, Doesn't ask its cast to detour too far from personalities they've played in past projects. 
fresh, It is unlike anything you have seen before-a film that constantly uses the tools of the form to produce emotional impact and yet doesn't allow that formal rigidity to defeat its human element. It's unforgettable.
fresh," An often capriciously mixed cocktail of war film and cross-cultural family melodrama, ""The Water Diviner"" marks an ambitious if emotionally manipulative directing debut for Russell Crowe."
fresh," tackles big ideas like the preservation of tradition and the overall reach of destiny, but also slyly suggests that the Triad of the 21st Century has evolved into something like a giant corporation."
fresh," In some ways the film is guilty of the kind of worship that made Garcia uneasy, but Bar-Lev's emotional connection to his subject is also an animating force."
rotten, How do you turn a great story into a mediocre one? Woke it up!
fresh," An extremely satisfying ending to the story of Lisbeth Salander, the tough Swedish cyber punk that actress Noomi Rapace has turned into an iconic New Age heroine."
fresh," Much of Tomcats is actually boisterously, crudely entertaining."
fresh, A film so bad and clumsy that seems a kind of self-help class. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten, An interesting story but ends up draining its narrative resources. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten, A seemingly interminable romantic travelogue that feels as though it takes as long to watch as the year-long spiritual quest it depicts.
rotten," A golden comic premise, directed to dross by Ken Scott, who also made the Canadian original (""Starbuck,"" from 2011) on which this Vince Vaughn vehicle is based."
fresh," The female protagonist, an economically privileged young woman turned workers'-rights organiser and something of an animal activist, makes the film both satisfying and uncommon."
fresh," Writer Nelson Greaves and director Levan Gabriadze do a decent job of creating genuine tension within the almost theatrical, proscenium-like arrangement of the computer screen."
rotten, makes the cliche-riddled guilty pleasure of Independence Day seem like the second coming of 2001: A Space Odyssey
rotten," The debut feature by Janicza Bravo takes on a perennial comic genre yet, like its main character, it's best described as a work in progress."
fresh," If you have even a passing interest in horses, you may find yourself smitten with this meditative doc."
fresh," Grindingly unpleasant yet undeniably hilarious, the movie might as well be called: Squid 2: This Time It's Mommy's Turn."
rotten," A slick soulless horror flick just in time for Halloween, more trick than treat."
rotten, A unbelievable thriller with a surfeit of unappealing characters.
fresh, This is fiercely original and seriously funny.
rotten," Co-writers/brothers Alex and David Pastor have taken what could have been a science ""future"" thriller and turned it into a science/less dud. "
fresh," By and large, it's a solid film."
fresh," Its straightforward simplicity aims it squarely at the kiddies and the kiddies alone, but that's okay -- few films intended for children these days are this gentle, this plainly decent."
rotten," Despite the efforts of both lead actors, as well as some rather contrived screenwriting by Alison Tilson, the romantic pairing of the somewhat effeminate Tsunashima and somewhat masculine Collette isn't really that believable."
fresh, Fascinating first-person account from the author herself of a complex masquerade that stunned the literary and celebrity worlds.
rotten," The usual cliches, mustering unsettling noises but nothing actually frightening."
rotten," It seems that it's time to admit that dressing actors in LED-studded catsuits, asking them to give performances on sterile white sets and handing the results to a team of computer animators is not a way to make a good movie."
rotten," The Little Death is just a mostly laughless tour of unlikeable, depressive suburbanites."
rotten," At times, it seems like the whole movie is based around making jokes about his well-kept mustache. This helps explain why the vanity project is so frenziedly boring and tedious."
rotten, ...a script that is so full of cliche's that I actually knew the end of the film 10 minutes before it ended.
fresh, This film has the exact same tone and flavor of its predecessors.
rotten, We're treated to bad digital effects attacking even worse actors.
fresh," The cast is generally good, but Rice's appealing sweetness is the movie's main attraction."
rotten, The words 'so bad it's good' strain to make themselves heard through the film's coarse bluster and grimy din.
rotten," Armed with only a few decent jokes, less successful performances, and a tone of classic cinema reverence that, in the end, even Bogdanovich seems tired of."
rotten," Although the vocal performances often amuse and delight, the overall design is charmless."
rotten, Non-Stop takes itself way too seriously.
rotten," The violence is too tantalizing, too stylized, too fetishistic - the film features killers dressed in fanciful Halloween costumes who dance and sing as they dismember people."
rotten," Destination Wedding aims to be the misanthrope's rom-com, but despite the charm of Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves, it's just plain unlikable."
fresh, ... savor the genius of Streep whipping her high-pitched Julia accent into a froth as she chops a mountain of onions into submission.
rotten," The rotting corpses, projectile insect vomit, and creepy geezers in black arrive pretty much on cue, as does the great Cicely Tyson as the obligatory old blind woman who ""sees"" more than most people with two good eyes."
rotten, The movie overstays its welcome merely by a factor of approximately eight.
fresh, An odd curio that remains quaint.
rotten," This making-of-a-star drama is old-fashioned and corny, and not in a good way."
fresh," It is unusual, emotionally satisfying and, in an echo of his early exploitation splatterfests, darkly funny."
fresh, ...never soft-pedals the treacherous byways and alternative routes that [protagonist] Cyril only narrowly avoids on his road to security and happiness. 
fresh," Step Brothers is the latest movie from Adam McKay, the director of Anchorman and Talladega Nights, and, like those two fine entertainments, it rejoices in making a virtue of its own rampant stupidity."
rotten, The level of dehumanized violence is disturbing -- more people get shot point-blank in the head in this movie than during a weeklong Deer Hunter cosplay convention.
fresh, Here's to wishing for more great films from this Apatow clan!!
rotten," Costanzo tugs on a lot of threads in this family tapestry, but the result is misshapen"
rotten," Generic battles, typical actioner."
rotten," This is an interesting story, but it's treated here in a fashion that's at once timorous and overstated."
rotten," It's not quite clear who this movie is for, what it is, or what it was even trying to be."
rotten," ... has honest intentions about communicating the dangers of addiction in intimate detail, and conveying the frustration and hopelessness that goes with recovery. Still, in this case, the powerful message takes on a predictable repetition."
rotten," Both Thwaites and McGregor are fine performers, but JR and Brendan are drawn in such broad, obvious strokes that it's impossible to get under the skin of their dynamic."
fresh," Lee, as he did in Malcolm X and Clockers, makes his hero's dread palpable, and though 25th Hour lacks the glittering brilliance of those films, I was held by the toughness and pity of Lee's gaze."
rotten," The film rolls downhill to Serious Town when Danielle finds her father, and although the performers are equipped to handle it, it gets more heavy-handed as it winds to a close."
rotten, ...unbelievably sloppy...
fresh, Quite simply the greatest film every made about the art of photography.
fresh, Brilliant and difficult.
rotten," Mainly the movie's about riding a bike at the speed of sound while your head is burning. They can do anything these days, which isn't quite the same as saying they should do anything these days."
fresh," Ferguson does not do for his subject what David Frost did for Nixon, but it's fascinating in its way. "
rotten," The film is based on Jane Hawking's memoir ""Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen"", yet you could be easily forgiven for thinking it was a dramatisation of Hawking's Wikipedia page. "
fresh, One thing is bound to come out of Cast Away -- a deserved best actor nomination for Hanks.
fresh," The Stoning Of Soraya M. hits you in the gut. It's a phenomenal piece of cinema, but there are many who will read about it and think, ""I don't need to go there."""
fresh," Days of Glory has received a rapturous reception in France, where it has struck a historical nerve with its belated recognition of the sacrifices of 130,000 North African colonial soldiers."
fresh, Inspired by a promise made... Remember is a potent thriller replete with big surprises.
fresh, How much you'll be entertained by The Hurricane Heist can be surmised by your reaction to the title.
fresh," The secret weapon of the film is cinematographer Michael Simmonds, who has a whole bag of tricks up his sleeve."
rotten," ...the noble patient, served up with heavy doses of tea and sympathy."
rotten," É uma pena que, gradualmente, deixe de ser um interessante estudo de personagem e se transforme em um drama tipicamente hollywoodiano."
rotten," Woody, what happened? You stink on toast. Paul Chambers, CNN."
rotten," Ridley Scott has ruined the Alien franchise...So far, Alien: Covenant is the year's most obscene Hollywood undertaking."
fresh," Clunky start apart, an efficient, grisly splatter sequel that's fine as far as it goes, but doesn't go far enough. For best results, engineer your own memory loss before going in."
fresh," You'll probably be happy to know that, as per this Kickstarter-funded documentary, the man in the puffy yellow suit is just as kind and loving as the overgrown fowl he portrays"
rotten," It's not bad, but it's just flawed enough for us to wonder about its purposelessness."
rotten," .. it's a ticking bomb story, but a bloated one, full of the bling of blockbuster superhero filmmaking, from the giant stunts to the choreographed fight sequences and the large scale destruction of bridges, streets, and entire fleets of police vehicles."
rotten," It's an exceedingly minor picture, an insignificant wisp that recycles familiar Allen themes behind only the thinnest of plots."
rotten," Where it's going is fascinating enough yet without an undercurrent of the human life caught in this horror, Thelma feels too stark an exercise. The film leaves us with its ideas on a theoretical level rather than a gut-wrenching one."
fresh, Callahan does the work and it's a powerful process. The meetings call out his excuses. Phoenix goes there in every stage of Callahan's self-destruction and redemption. It's a great portrait of accountability.
rotten," Beowulf is ambitious, overbearing and hollow; it goes overboard to impress, yet it never feels truly inventive or imaginative."
rotten," Note to Hollywood: If a movie like Life As We Know It needs diaper gags to make us laugh, you're in trouble."
fresh," Visual ingenuity, wry humour, and French self-parody add up to a strange and touching experience."
rotten," A simple, old-fashioned adventure story, combined with a coming-of-age tale, that could stand to be considerably less simple."
rotten," The Bye Bye Man doesn't offer more than a few banging doors to startle viewers, and that's hardly enough."
rotten," The movie, instead of embracing its budgetary limitations, gives off a distracting sense of trying to punch above its weight class."
fresh," You may feel a slight sense of opportunity lost, but you'll leave the film satisfied, perhaps more than you've been by any Bond film in a decade."
rotten," Sure, the period looks perfect. Too bad the rest of Lawless is so flawed. "
fresh, The best of Woody Allen.
rotten, There's so much talent on display here that it's sad to see it wasted on this nonsense.
fresh, A quirky and bloody meditation on the rising tide of violence in America by the Coen brothers.
rotten," The film as a whole may be lacking in coherence and emotional punch, but there are some marvelous sequences."
rotten," The chemistry with the girls was 100 percent there, and there were some big comedic moments, but overall it misses."
fresh," It's beautifully made, and lovely to look at."
fresh, Funny and unpretentious.
rotten, Director Ana Kokkinos has an eye for local color but spends little time developing the supporting characters.
fresh, Caro is both subtle and a deck-stacker.
fresh," It may not be for everyone -- the movie requires a high tolerance for statements such as 'there's only one instant, and it's now, and it's eternity' -- but it's like nothing else in theaters right now."
fresh," In this nasty, verbose comedy, Woody Allen the director has cast Woody Allen the actor as a foul-mouthed, self-absorbed, sex-obsessed writer."
fresh," ...the juggling act that all remakes strive for, but few manage to capture. Encore!"
rotten," ...uneven and, with abrupt transitions from one animation style to another, distracting."
fresh," An impressively sustained slow-burn parable from writer-director Jeff Nichols, shot with ominous beauty, guarding its mysteries with care."
fresh, A bizarre and mesmerising journey to the heart of Cloud Cuckoo Land.
fresh, Chef is certainly a tasty offering - maybe not as filling as others and it runs out of ingredients by the end - but it's certainly worth a nibble.
fresh," An ambitious yet flawed effort, but one executed with undoubted style and verve."
fresh," The film tilts more toward action than ethics, but it's still a good film. "
rotten, If only the movie's writers (there were half a dozen) and directors (there were two -- one bailed after two weeks) had created a movie one-fourth as funny as this sketch was.
rotten," Solid work from stars Benicio Del Toro and Mathieu Amalric lubricate the movie's hunt for understanding, but overlength tends to erase the effort's achievements in the end. "
rotten, There are these elements in it that are quite tough and nasty that it doesn't earn the right to have.
rotten," While it has some spectacular set pieces and dollops of goofy, wisecracking humor, Monster House rests on such a flimsily constructed narrative framework that it starts collapsing in on itself, long before the predictably over-the-top conclusion."
fresh," While Casino Royale was the perfect mix of the old and new, Quantum of Solace, while oftentimes thrilling, is more of a downtrodden experience that only shows a sporadic sense of humor."
rotten," A barely warm dish of Cold War leftovers that shows its hand too early, then works itself into an increasingly implausible tangle of knotty plot developments without ever mustering much intensity."
fresh," A haunting, riveting film that's as self-serving as it is revelatory. It's movie-making as therapy, and I hope it worked."
fresh, There is still an authenticity to the performances that mannered writing cannot undo.
rotten, This raw docudrama is too jarring and painful to recommend to a wide audience. 
rotten, Duffy orchestrates the resulting carnage like an inebriate spinning fourth-rate Peckinpah tales.
rotten," Ballast lacks ballast. Much praised by aficionados of minimalist indie cinema -- hey, who needs a plot when you've got mood? -- it's a wearying slog through anomie in a Mississippi Delta township."
fresh," Roberts, haughty in Notting Hill, is defensive here and it is an interesting departure as her charm is shown to be the protective coloration of someone with a need to please and a fear of commitment."
rotten," A visually-captivating fantasy for teenage males with raging hormones, the demographic most apt to enjoy watching an invincible vixen in spandex waste wave after wave of mindless mutants. "
rotten," If this dull, cramped and literal film is any indication, Keillor's sturdy and expansive sense of imagination defies physical manifestation."
rotten," It lacks the will, mandate, and talent even to attempt filmed entertainment."
rotten," Yet another shallow, mind-numbing and overproduced Hollywood B-movie masquerading as an A-movie. It's the equivalent of watching a video game on a big screen."
fresh," Bellocchio's wearying analysis of mother love is the least compelling mark of the film's nationality. More rewarding is his use of a recognisably Italian cinematic style, one involving visual richness and melancholy explorations of urban society."
fresh," Ghosts of Girlfriends Past might be one of the most unoriginal films ever made, but it works anyway."
fresh," It's Oscar winner Rylance's warm-hearted motion-capture performance -- his BFG moves with human-like fluidity and grace -- along with John Williams' familiar and sweet score, that gives The BFG its soul."
fresh," The Paranormal Activity movies are built on fundamental horror concepts, and those fundamentals still hold."
rotten, There are a lot of people local and abroad responsible for this dismal film.
rotten," The film essentially disintegrates before your eyes, with Koreeda displaying little of the quiet elegance he's built his entire career upon."
rotten, It has all the feel of a clone.
fresh, Veteran British director Roger Spottiswoode (Turner & Hooch; Mesmer) doesn't push the cute factor beyond endurance and punches through some points about some of the harsher realities of poverty in modern Britain.
rotten," A routine of shenanigans and sleepy dramatics, realized through blocky, rigid animation that doesn't feel very special standing in the shadows of industry giants."
rotten, It's not clear why the film needs to exist; the story itself isn't compelling enough and the filmmaker remains agnostic as ever when it comes to expressing a point of view.
rotten," ""The Armstrong Lie"" feels like wheel-spinning, outraged that Armstrong lied not only to millions of people but to Gibney and then not pushing the evidence to the finish line."
rotten," Blitz is lost here, flailing with terrible scenes, trying to make something meaningful stick with stillborn material and a dead-eyed cast. "
rotten, A flimsy sentimental comedy with more product plugs and fewer laughs than might have been hoped for.
rotten," What in the world is Mr. Radcliffe doing to himself in his post-Harry Potter movie career? Movies are supposed to be entertaining, and directors are supposed to protect their actors, not expose them to derision. "
rotten," That Puzzle comes across as sincere but overdetermined may be the fault of its director, Marc Turtletaub...Puzzle certainly isn't a bad movie. It's mostly disappointing because it seems that it should be better than it is."
rotten, Director David Fincher has solidified a place for himself as the penultimate director of the 90's.
fresh, Mission: Impossible - Fallout is a ferocious heart-pounding cardio workout in your cinema sweat. 
rotten," A hilariously terrible noir-cum-brainteaser from Steven Knight, starring Matthew McConaughey's bottom."
rotten, Where is Judd Apatow when we need him?
fresh," I'm not big into awkward comedy, but The Overnight is so deft and surprising that I almost enjoyed the feeling."
fresh," Heller's empathy and, let's be honest, her denial of prurience appears to free Powley from embarrassment. She's seizing this part, not shrinking from it."
fresh, A rare kind of masterpiece from director Alfonso Cuarón.
fresh, This Portugese oddity represents arthouse film-making taken to insanely inscrutable heights.
fresh," Pugh's and Ackie's performances here are electric and expressive, the former portraying ultimate power, the latter ultimate fear."
rotten," That busy-ness is part of what makes it impossible to fully embrace this movie, because you can never completely forget that it's less about telling an individual story than keeping a machine chugging along."
rotten," The footage is too long in the first half for so little raw material, and even in its second part it's free from certain excesses of verbiage. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten," The movie means well enough, yet Zaytoun doesn't do enough to upset expectations, trusting in the power of warm orchestral strings and softening demeanors to coax the viewer into a deceptive comfort zone. "
rotten, It's main problem in truth stems from the fact that Gillan and Webber have no spark between them whatsoever.
fresh," This one gives you all the requisite chills and thrills, and still manages to be about something."
fresh," While it may not be as good as ""An Unexpected Journey,"" ""The Desolation of Smaug"" is still an outstanding continuation of the saga that gives fans just about everything they could want from such an adaptation."
fresh," I suggest you take a chance on ""Submarine"" and find out if its particular comic angst rings any bells, be you male or be you female, Welsh or American, 16 or 61."
rotten," This crowd-pleaser suffers from melodramatic embellishments and is too eager to inspire through courtroom histrionics, but at least it shines a worthwhile spotlight on a deserving subject."
fresh, You may wonder what a fresh look at the events could possibly add to our knowledge. The answer turns out to be a great deal.
rotten," Performances are adequate, but mostly uninspired."
fresh, The film works really well. It maintains the spirit of the original whilst being different enough from it -- not that anyone in the target audience would care -- it's funny and jogs along nicely.
rotten," Talk about being boxed in: This thriller is half-""24,"" half-""Buried"" and, despite a few twists, unable to move anywhere."
rotten, Will Chris Hansen and the Dateline NBC team burst out of the woods to catch that predator Jacob?
fresh," Macedonian writer-director Milcho Manchevski uses the geometry of circles to build this harrowing, poetic drama about the incomprehensibility-and timelessness-of hatred, violence, and war."
rotten, Doesn't crash and burn - mostly because it barely gets off the ground.
fresh," New-to-these-shores director/scripter, South African Gavin Hood, does a wonderful job adapting the novel by Athol Fugard, bringing to real life the story of ""Tsotsi."""
rotten," A shameless rip-off of indie hit Napoleon Dynamite, this New Zealand comedy may contain the odd laugh, but it doesn't come with many original ideas."
fresh," ...many eye-boggling shots of the vistas covered entirely by fields of grapes that are, in themselves, worth the price of admission...a superb film capturing the ambience of winemaking magnificently and the family disputes that accompany it."
rotten, The story of Barry Seal is indeed a fascinating one but this film just doesn't know what to do with it-it is the kind that makes you want to immediately seek out a book or straightforward documentary that offer a fuller picture of what transpired.
rotten, The lack of a proper title is only the first sign that it's barely half-baked.
rotten," One of those sadly dependent independent films, every bit as formulaic as any Hollywood blockbuster."
rotten," [The big moral is] ""Don't worry if you don't fit in, because you will eventually without even trying."" Yeah, seriously."
rotten, Why good actors like Forest Whitaker and Liev Schreiber have taken major roles in this wrongheaded effort is perhaps the most compelling question posed by this film.
fresh, Marvel at its strangeness
rotten," The mission is noble. The result, disastrous. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten," For my money, there was too much turning and not enough prestige in The Prestige."
rotten," As a half-hour ""Twilight Zone"" episode, it might have been able to hold your attention, but at almost one-and-three-quarter hours, it just tests your patience."
rotten," Puss in Boots is a great opportunity squandered, which is all the more ironic considering the plot involves a golden goose."
rotten, It's just affable enough to survive a disastrous last 10 minutes.
fresh," There's no doubt that this is confident, striking, film-making and if it merely serves as the final step in Gibson's rehabilitation and allows him to forge ahead with his new career as a director of true vision and power."
rotten, ...drops the ball almost immediately by emphasizing some seriously hackneyed plot twists and an overall atmosphere of predictability...
rotten," It's Nazis, melodrama and intrigue galore as Paul Verhoeven adds his patented Verhoeven touch to this sordid tale of a Jewish girl in hiding during World War II."
rotten, Painfully unnecessary.
fresh," Haneke modus operandi is to withhold information from the audience for as long as possible, forcing us to do our own investigative work. His admirers will no doubt rise to the challenge and should be amply rewarded."
rotten, It's a great idea but there are too many confusing sup-plots and no satisfactory resolution.
fresh," In a field rife with impostors and poseurs, Del Toro, like his mentors, is the real deal. It's good to have him working his magic again."
fresh," Shyamalan should consider a chicken-or-the-egg question of his own making: What comes first, the plot or the plot twist?"
rotten," ... more a succession of increasingly salacious sketches, most capped by Diaz dropping the f-bomb. Indeed, Diaz may establish some kind of record for onscreen profanity by an actress."
rotten," The comedic parts of Pixels must have been experiencing a technical glitch, because I can count the amount of times I laughed on one hand (most thanks to a fake Toru Iwatani)."
fresh, Eleanor Tomlinson and Aidan Turner shine through with a realism that few artists - and certainly not van Gogh - could ever hope to capture.
fresh," Julian Rosefeldt's Manifesto offers many pleasures. Some of them are conceptual, some of them are surreal, and some of them are Cate Blanchett."
fresh," The fact that ""Beyond the Lights"" is so effective at both celebrating and critiquing extravagance and artifice can be credited to Prince-Bythewood's shrewd understanding of the highly pitched cinematic vernacular she's working with."
fresh," Sans magic hammer, Chris Hemsworth's career as a leading man is spotty at best. It seems he just needed horse co-stars."
rotten," Once you leave the theater, you become hard-pressed to remember much about this film."
fresh, [I haven't] read any of the books but was gripped from the get-go ...
fresh," So often today, the older generation rejects movies because they think they're not for them. But Quartet is."
rotten," Michael Bay repeats himself, same cinematography and lighting, confusing editing, explosions and lots of noise. Very boring. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten, Brigsby Bear lacks the maturity to portray its subject matter with the depth it requires.
fresh," The main attraction is the tortured dynamic in Tolstoy's marriage, and it's played out with a vibrant pathos that's equally funny and sad, making The Last Station an endearing, if not essential, destination."
rotten," It's as if veteran director Edward Zwick signed on to tell one story and got railroaded into telling four different ones instead. The resulting film is a saccharine-fuelled, cliché-ridden mess."
fresh," [Crowe's] work wasn't anything out of the ordinary, but his ability to be in front and behind the camera is something to respect. [full review in Spanish]"
rotten," It ain't scary, folks."
fresh, ...it really does expose how class-based so many of our horror tropes are.
fresh, Homes in on a middle ground between jumpy postmodernism and Oscar-bait uplift.
fresh, Definitely worth seeing because of exciting scenes with Smith and Voight sparring verbally as Ali and Cossell.
rotten," Although involving, this remake of a recent French film never reaches the anticipated heights of excitement and suspense."
fresh," Brawl In Cell Block 99 is an audacious, assured, and abundant helping of pulp exploitation that's not to be missed."
fresh, Seeing The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is like having a second date with a woman who made you fall in love at first sight.
rotten," A comedy where every situation is taken to the extreme, it almost feels like a long music video filmed during spring break. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten," With six writers (including Hart) and Malcolm D. Lee's call-action-and-step-next-door-for-coffee direction, the movie can hardly help being what it is: a half-baked, disconnected parade of gags and undeveloped episode ideas."
fresh," Country Music, Drama, Romance, Redemption"
rotten," Campanella's work here is certainly polished and well-acted, but there's little that one can do with hoary material like this. The secrets that it holds are scarcely worth discovering."
fresh, British actor Andrew Garfield replaces Tobey Maguire and makes for a twitchy and charming Spidey.
fresh," There's a skill to pulling off slapstick, and Bogdanovich achieves it here with finesse."
rotten, The epitome of filmmaking by the manual.
rotten," Tony Jaa doesn't possess the authority of Lee, the charisma of Chan or the intensity of Li, though he does project the same sleepy-eyed blandness as Van Damme."
fresh," If you're willing to go with that - an affectionate character study of a bloke in a massive papier mache head - you'll find Frank to be a richly rewarding film, and the title character to be one you can't help but fall in love with."
rotten," There's very little that is natural about the storytelling in this crudely conceived, genetically engineered monster of a narrative. And there is no insight into motherhood that you couldn't find in a pound shop greeting card."
rotten," I Don't Know How She Does It purports to be about the difficult choices of modern motherhood, but it's too prim and cautious a movie to dip a pedicured toe into the murky waters of real choice."
fresh," Recount, an efficient and relentless enactment of the strategists on both sides of the Florida controversy, shows an accident that was waiting to happen."
rotten, You Were Never Really Here doesn't quite work for me ... but it is certainly worth watching once it hits streaming services for Phoenix's performance alone.
fresh," A brilliant thriller, made by a filmmaker at the top of his game."
fresh, Jones and Swank are both in fine form in Jones' sobering and unsentimental -- but thoroughly engrossing -- anti-Western. 
rotten," The film tries very hard for quirky, but (barely) manages annoying. "
fresh," The problem at the center of Zero Dark Thirty is that knowing and not knowing constitute a process, a process in which people tell lies and get hurt, in which costs can be overwhelming."
rotten, A rapidly wearying comedy that mistakes crudeness with humor.
fresh," Detropia's filmmakers stay out of the picture, hanging back to allow the viewer to absorb the meaning of Detroit's fate. It is even more complex than we thought."
fresh, Bogart famously said that it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. The Coens believe that too. They just have a way more thoroughly sick and twisted way of pointing it out.
fresh, This is action movie-making at its most suave.
rotten," After a decent enough opening it becomes a fairly ordinary affair, the principal attraction residing in the heroine's weirdly flexible sword."
rotten, The only thing the new Carrie inspires is a good bit of yawning.
rotten, A strenuous attempt to recycle a vastly funnier minor classic.
fresh, A splendid adaptation.
fresh," Although packed with compelling archive footage, this never quite gets into Joplin's head, heart or soul."
rotten," At times, though, it's ludicrous even for kids' stuff, and its undersea make-believe means we face an even heavier battering from CGI than comic-book movies usually deliver."
fresh," A thoughtful, hopeful film, filled with dedicated and inspiring advocates, and the courtroom scenes are absolutely fascinating."
fresh, I can't remember the last time I smiled through an entire film.
rotten, My NYE resolution is to be more positive. I found something positive to say about Fifty Shades Freed. We're finally done with this crap and that is a positive. Right?
fresh," Sporadically bawdy, it's a sloppy, sanitized sex comedy in which the young women make their own decisions."
fresh," Binoche, like her compatriot Isabelle Huppert, is an actress so adept at serenely conducting inner turmoil that we risk taking their range of notes and tones for granted. Even by her standards, however, this is complex, quietly symphonic work ..."
fresh," True to form, Garner creates a strapping action character with as many foibles as muscles."
fresh," More potent as a cautionary tale than future noir, Anon's digital dystopia certainly gets a Like, even if it doesn't quite warrant a Share."
fresh," If you don't mind spending (alot of) time with some interesting characters, check it out. Just don't expect a focused story. (The first half of this is still really good though)"
fresh, Powerful drama about forced marriage has mature themes. 
fresh," We champion the recent marriage equality act, but it's right to focus on the long, painstaking road that got us to this point in time."
rotten," The third chapter in Gru's saga chose not to follow the franchise's predecessors, instead resorting to the current company model: noisy, colorful animation light on heart. "
fresh," ""The Lost Arcade"" speaks to a greater cultural shift towards personal isolation without putting too fine a point on it and the desire by some to rebel against it. "
fresh," The film, adapted from Reif Larsen's novel, is beautifully shot in the Jeunet manner."
fresh, It was just portraying this one friendship and it did a great job. I love both lead performances and the script is excellent.
rotten," The only elements of The White King that prevent it from being an unmitigated failure are a striking visual aesthetic and solid production values. However, these do not prevent Alex Helfrecht and Jorg Tittel's venture being one to miss."
rotten," Despite its basic stupidity, it's the most compelling and audience-pleasing of Singleton's sell-out movies."
rotten, Rodriguez understood the project the better of the two directors and made the more appropriate of the two films. Tarantino appears to have gotten into making his film and then forgot what he was supposed to be doing.
rotten," It's not smart enough to actually pull off what it purports to do, and it's not free enough to simply enjoy itself."
fresh, Not Reitman's most exciting work but still a watchable political thriller.
fresh," Battle of the Sexes is, at best, a light volley of banter and debate over important topics, rather than a hard-hitting expose with contemporary ties to ongoing gender discussions (which it easily could have been). "
fresh, Contains a spooky ambiance from start to almost-finish.
fresh," A terrifically entertaining documentary about a strange, murky corner of the adult tickling world."
fresh," Nolan hypnotizes us with his elegant dreamscapes, but uses them to draw attention back to the figures at the heart of it all."
fresh," Like Kraft Mac & Cheese or your favorite old sweats with the Duct Tape waistband, familiarity can be comforting. Megamind doesn't break any new ground other than being the rare family flick that the whole family can enjoy."
rotten, 'Runner Runner' is a thriller that doesn't want to do the leg work to actually be a good thriller. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)
fresh, A monstrously funny alien-invasion-zombie-horror-comedy.
rotten," Despite some promising elements, Life amounts to a middling (and derivative) sci-fi horror/thriller that never fully realizes its potential."
rotten, It's Die Hard in the Oval Office again 
rotten," All this would probably play better with the assistance of some weed, but it would be irresponsible to review a film while intoxicated."
fresh," While it's not as frightening as other del Toro offerings, there's no escaping the constant anticipation of having the pants scared off you. It lurks around every atmospheric corner."
rotten, About a threatening as a Nine Inch Nails music video.
rotten," Offers nothing beyond irritating characters, mean-spirited encounters, and boring finales."
rotten," Screenwriter Alan Ball (""American Beauty,"" HBO's ""Six Feet Under"") makes his directorial debut adapting Alicia Erian's novel from a particularly repellant male perspective."
rotten," Ultimately, the movie will be remembered (if at all) for its guerilla marketing campaign, which the city of Boston took to be a terrorist threat and cost Turner Broadcasting $2 million, more than the cost of making the film."
fresh," Sandler's latest film isn't much of step up from those previous encounters, but it retains all of their good-natured affability."
rotten," [The movie] targets 12- to 16-year-old girls, and they're going to enjoy it. But it's hard to imagine someone outside that spectrum getting very excited."
fresh," For the most part Raymond Depardon's documentary is an engaging exploration into the lives of people at the very edge of society, filmed with warmth, humour and humanity."
rotten," Cheesy, asinine, convoluted and ludicrous. On the plus side, if your eyeballs need a vigorous workout, this will have them rolling nonstop."
fresh," If you haven't had enough underdog tales about kids from the wrong side of the tracks trying to make it big, Max Minghella's directorial debut Teen Spirit hits all the usual check marks to provide a stylish if familiar entry to the theme."
rotten, [A] lazily ingratiating spy spoof.
rotten, Feels like 25 very brief stage plays jammed together -- maybe five of which are worth sitting through.
rotten," While maintaining the mystery is key to a movie like this, and while the set-up necessitates numerous overlapping threads, there are far too many and it proves to be a fatal distraction."
rotten," You'd expect the cast to be having more fun in a Robocop movie, but with the exception of Jackson everyone here plays it totally, boringly straight."
fresh," With cinematography this gorgeously monochromatic, and an allegory so entertainingly ludicrous, all can be forgiven."
rotten," Like its main character, the film just isn't the same when Rex isn't around."
fresh, Delivers a smackdown to our emotions
rotten, The interaction between the leads is about as enticing as watching paint dry!
rotten," ""Parker"" quickly settles into a lurching routine of explosive, predictable set pieces. "
fresh, Connery delivers a touching father/son relationship and an interesting look at the moral certainties of Victorian Britain.
fresh," The Break-Up is ultimately a big budget heart-heavy indy film, and not a slapstick broad comedy as the ads would have you think..."
rotten," Has Pixar lost its magic recipe? Ratatouille is filled with fairly generic animated imagery, a few modest chases, a couple of good gags, not a lot of laughs."
rotten, Annie is contemporary and urban but feels strangely small-and not in an intimate way. 
fresh," Languorous, droll and ultimately affecting."
rotten, Probably has the approximate cultural staying power of its title.
fresh," Free Solo has been heavily pushed for Best Documentary this year. Though very good, it's unlikely to make it to the top. But it is by far the scariest."
rotten," If this is what teenagers want as entertainment, as a society, we're in deeper trouble than we realize."
rotten, Fact-based but politically cautious.
fresh," While not the strongest story of the whole saga, Cowboy Bebop: The Movie is an extended dip in a uniquely mind-bending pool."
fresh," The ideas Egoyan explores test dangerous waters of cowardice and courage, prejudice and forgiveness, and unknowable truths that divide and devastate."
rotten," Unsettles without illuminating, marred by narcotic pacing and a blank lead performance."
fresh," As emotional as the rescue effort was, equally fascinating are the technical challenges that the crews had to overcome to bring the men to the Earth's surface. "
fresh, One of the most gripping Marvel-inspired movies yet.
fresh," ROCKY with Robots? You betcha, and it works!"
rotten," If you really want to live life to the fullest, step one is to avoid wasting an hour and a half of your life in a theater showing Last Holiday."
fresh," Parents of younger children need at least one animated banker to get them through the looming summer holidays, and Despicable Me 3 is about as safe a bet as a desperate dad on a rainy afternoon could hope for."
fresh," Blue Is the Warmest Colour is the only mainstream film so far to treat a lesbian affair on equal terms with a heterosexual one. This is a proper romance, with all the usual jealousies and tiny idiocies."
rotten," ""On Chesil Beach"" can't even be called nihilistic, because even nihilism requires commitment. "
rotten," In the end, this is a film that even Madhavan cannot make better. Here is one honest question for the makers: why make a film that looks like a farce even on paper?"
rotten," The script has a stale air, like something that was doing the rounds for a long time before David Ross found backers to make a film out of it."
fresh, A poignant portrait of marriage and a dramatic chronicle of hardships and justice.
fresh," Psychedelic & substantive, PTA illuminates the '70s with a vibrant crime story carried by the audacious Joaquin Phoenix."
rotten," Sort of ho-hum stuff, but nice to see a cameo from Rhys Darby, from TV's Flight of the Conchords."
fresh, Teen-friendly romcom about love's ups and downs.
fresh," The Light Between Oceans has one eye on the coming awards seasons, the other on delivering some wonderfully weepy entertainment. Expect success on both fronts."
fresh," Smart, emotionally deep, exciting, beautiful to behold, and culturally relevant, Dawn is quite simply a great film."
rotten," The pacing is unyieldingly slow, while also missing that sense of creeping escalation that makes the better films of the Romanian art house moment so dreadfully effective"
rotten, A laughably absurd fantasy that goes nowhere fast.
fresh, The most valuable aspects of the film are in its textures and brushstrokes and not so much in its plot. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten," The Adderall Diaries is about nothing but itself. It's not fiction, it's forgery. It's not adaptation, it's erasure."
fresh," A perfectly gauged performance by Wiig holds this ramshackle comedy-drama together, as she plays a woman forced to confront everything she has always hated about herself."
rotten," The Punisher is Hollywood's second attempt to interpret Marvel Comics' black-clad vigilante, and it's hard to see why the town keeps bothering."
rotten, It provides an incomplete portrait of lives strained by the urgency of keeping up with a honey-maker's schedule.
fresh," Although a bit short on laughs for a romcom, 'No Strings Attached' has its heart in the right place."
rotten, Impossible to follow.
fresh, A delightfully dark teen comedy with a frequently funny script and superb performances from a terrific cast.
rotten," It's exhausting, yet emotionally unengaging."
rotten," This road picture's many detours, the stuff that should be right in Linklater's wheelhouse, mostly feel, well, like vexing delays."
rotten, Tweens might appreciate the sugar-rush ghoulishness; Famous Monsters of Filmland fans and discerning kids-flick viewers may find themselves reaching for torches.
rotten," Jon Favreau draws heavily on his film's animated predecessor for plot, characterizations, songs, and set pieces, but doesn't know how to fit these familiar elements into his own coherent vision."
rotten," HBO's adaptation of Ray Bradbury's classic ""Fahrenheit 451"" ultimately loses the plot."
rotten," It's just a bore; quoth the raven, ""Go see something else."""
rotten," It's not a bad movie, but no matter how long it spends in the war zone, it still feels like a tourist."
rotten," The filmmaker, having spent his career making various iterations of the same nonsense, has lost his verve."
rotten," Nothing in ""We're Back"" captures the eye or the imagination."
fresh," Jeremy Saulnier's Green Room is a ferocious, relentless thriller..."
fresh," The internet has fundamentally changed the lives of every single person on the Earth, and such a seismic shift in how people live their lives fascinates Herzog, and we're lucky enough that he wishes to share his fascination with the rest of us."
fresh," The perfect antidote to glossy documentaries about teen music sensations, offering a realistic look at wearying grind of the industry machine."
fresh, ...does boast its fair share of gripping moments.
fresh," Gotz Spielmann smoothly transports us from the seedy Vienna red light district to a tranquil farmhouse setting in this tense, and even a little naughty, revenge tale."
rotten," A film that offers a flat, low-key dramatisation of true events from more than 30 years ago."
rotten," Directed by Stacy Title, the film is predictable and filled with cheap jump scares... "
fresh, Maggie Smith should be her own U.N. World Heritage site. 
fresh, Completely fun. Dujardin defies time periods. Bejo is all sparkly effervescence.
rotten," Neither as adroitly funny as Franken's comic routines, nor as notable as his conversion to the fine art of politics, this is a 90-minute 'What If?' with no discernible answer."
fresh," Although the film is probably a tad too leisurely to find a major distributor, it deserves attention for the fine performances at the center of this well drawn canvas."
fresh, A fond celebration of a female friendship shaped by the threat of global annihilation and the first stirrings of the Swinging Sixties.
fresh," Annihilation is a visionary film that pushes the boundaries of the human imagination. Garland has yet again proven that he is not only a talented screenwriter, but an even more talented director. "
rotten," Even if you can get past the plot holes (and that's a big IF), you'll still be bored by this standard action-thriller. There's very little to get the heart pumping."
fresh, Cheers to all for tempering bile with humor and compassion. Sappy? Maybe. Also irresistible fun.
rotten," I, too, once enjoyed the Minions, in the small doses that they came in. But the extra-strength ""Minions"" is, for better or for worse, too much of a good thing."
rotten," In a manner similar to Gus Van Sant's Psycho, it's merely a high-resolution photocopy devoid of its revered predecessors' soul."
fresh," [W]hile the cinematic version of his farce An Ideal Husband isn't too far from ideal, it's almost too polite."
fresh, The film balances two related themes with insight: the guilt in the aftermath of tragedy and the challenges of a relationship that moves from unwanted to ominous.
rotten," Watching ""This Means War"" is like have someone on Ecstasy describe a movie to you in the middle of a rave. It's a date movie if you're dating someone you don't like."
rotten, M. Night Shyamalan's big-screen live-action version of the popular Nickelodeon animated TV series constitutes a form of Chinese water torture in which tin-ear line-readings take the place of drips.
fresh," Syriana, this ain't. Ridley Scott's latest misses the scope, texture or depth to dig into the moral mess of the war on terror. But this entertaining techno-thriller feeds greedily off star performances from Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Strong."
fresh," Eschewing narration or direct questioning, the directors instead employ a vast archive of consistently engaging clips from Nader's many congressional battles."
fresh, Terriffic thriller that breaks through its genre.
fresh," Hard to recommend, as it was so sad but, on the other hand, it was so good at what it is like to be so sad."
fresh, Body of Lies moves so fast you don't notice its oddball structure.
fresh," Starts out great, but runs out of gas near the end."
rotten," Is there a plot sandwiched between the numerous costume changes? Actually, there are several non sequitur subplots woven together -- and that, along with a dearth of acting talent, is Spice World's biggest flaw. "
fresh," Ali: Fear Eats the Soul might sound like improbable, contrived soap opera. It doesn't play that way."
fresh," The film offers something much deeper, and what is not said makes it refreshing, and beautiful."
fresh," Fueled by Tom Cruise's propulsive, sometimes literally death-defying performance, this fourth installment is arguably the strongest of the series."
fresh," Funny and poignant and full of life, Up easily qualifies as one of the best movies of the year so far. Go with someone you care about."
fresh," As a director, (Quinn Shephard) crafted a film that's moody, raw, enthralling, and haunting."
fresh," Playful, amusing, and illuminating, Varda's latest docu is at once an engaging personal memoir of a rich life and an informal look at the French New Wave, of which she was a co-founder and the only significant female member."
rotten, A fascinating character study in self-destructive alcoholism utterly undone by an absurd in-the-extreme finale. 
fresh," This is a sometimes brilliant, occasionally infuriating, visually astonishing extravaganza of embarrassing self-pity."
rotten," The anxiety is deafening in this flimsy symphony of shattered lives, which -- like that confounding Oscar winner Crash -- confuses entropy for empathy."
rotten," In any other universe, Jerico's story would be ludicrous. "
rotten, An erratic episodic comedy about just how funny a fetish can be.
rotten," It's hard to fault HBO for letting him indulge in this flight of fancy, particularly given all the marquee names he attracts. Still, without an ability to focus those appetites, Clear History yields the occasional chuckle, but somewhat curbed enthusiasm."
fresh," A sharp social satire of contemporary Mexico, held together by the slapstick glue of García and Luna's country-boy antics."
fresh," ""Gravity"" is a visual marvel, yet it's more than eye candy."
rotten," We are treated to far too much detail about trying to house train Tulip and exactly when, where and how she relieves herself."
rotten," Basic, slightly garish computer animation."
fresh," Of its time, surely, 'The Jazz Singer' is nevertheless better than one expects going in."
fresh," A potential cult hit in the making, call this Dazed And Confused for the Members Only set."
rotten," As sleazy as they come. And, much like the person we continue to date even though we know we shouldn't, it's kinda hard not to feel a little affection for it."
rotten," As the basis for a movie, it makes for a moving love story; but it doesn't really make much sense of two messy, complicated true lives."
fresh, An extremely confident and undeniably well-made Vietnam war movie...
rotten," Awe-inspiringly, world-historically awful."
fresh," A fantastic music doc with a surprising twist; which, when done as well as it is here, works just as effectively whether you know what's coming or not."
rotten," At what point do we stop applauding the Duplass brothers for their gumption and stick-to-itiveness and admit that, maybe, their storytelling just isn't so hot?"
rotten, Leave your sense of logic at the door or you'll be driven to distraction by annoying 'How come...' questions.
fresh," Relevant, well-meaning and a bit arid."
fresh," It's only real downfall is its lack of ambition to be more than decent. Saldanha has also been unerringly safe in most of his story telling choices, with little unexpected character development and quite a bit of overly tidy moralizing."
fresh, The premise of this sensitive drama is so chilling that it's not easy to watch. But events unfold in such a naturalistic way that we are drawn in emotionally.
fresh," All Governments Lie expands its critical scope by tracking down other deceptive public institutions whose credibility also deserves debunking, mainly corporate organizations and the mass media."
fresh," Generally, the comic pieces are sturdier than the abbreviated dramas. ...As might be expected, a couple of the chapters are misfires... Happily, 'Paris' saves some of its prime material for the last half-hour."
rotten," Yep, it might have taken seven years, but the 300 franchise has returned with more hysterically historical butchery for your entertainment pleasure."
rotten," Essentially a watered-down version of Searching for Bobby Fischer, Gifted is earnest but phony."
fresh," Cartel Land is not a fun watch but it is a compelling one. It has all the larger than life characters, gang violence and government corruption of a fictional crime drama made horribly tragic by its reality."
rotten, It never got weird enough for me.
rotten," The third chapter in Gru's saga chose not to follow the franchise's predecessors, instead resorting to the current company model: noisy, colorful animation light on heart. "
fresh, A Good American is a documentary against the war on truth.
fresh," In addition to a solid script and nearly perfect voice casting (Nicolas Cage gets his best role in years), the animation is a marvel. "
fresh," In an age where every film is getting a remake or a reboot, Pet Sematary might actually be better than the original. It's terrifying, twisted, heartbreaking, morbidly funny, and a hell of a fun time."
rotten," Through it all, Jason Momoa... tosses off coyly bluff one-liners with understated humor that goes to waste in this bloated and sludgy movie."
rotten, #Horror fails to even work as an cult oddity. 
rotten, The problem isn't the myriad plot threads. It's that there's no clear through line that unites them...
fresh," Crossing The Bridge was shot with an eye toward the kinetic, and cut with an impatience that shortchanges some of the artists, but keeps the rhythm lively."
fresh," Individual stories bog down the film's pace, but The Host recovers quickly to redefine horror for the new millennium. This you have to see."
rotten," Writer-director Reg Traviss gives the shoot-outs plenty of welly, but the dialogue is mostly dire and the action sometimes grinds to a halt for an earnest oration on the politics of graffiti art or postcode gang violence."
rotten, Welcome to the Machismo Express.
rotten, Black Creek is unwatchable. It is a film with the appeal of a damp sock.
rotten," Fletcher ably blends ballet and hip-hop, but the filming itself is often clumsy, and Tatum's relentless African American impersonation quickly wears out its welcome."
fresh," Rich with themes of jealousy, contempt, and lust, Z for Zachariah explores the internal conflict between the needs of the flesh and of the soul."
rotten," All in all, I'm pretty sure Hunter S. Thompson had hallucinations like this."
rotten, The sum doesn't quite add up to the potential of its parts.
fresh," Berlinger and Sinofsky have raised the bar even higher with subjects who dare to risk exposing their raw psyches, warts and all."
rotten," A post-apocalyptic pandemic movie that's more grade-Z than ""World War Z."""
fresh," Emotionally raw, emotionally riveting. No Lesbian Bed Death here."
rotten," For all its sound and fury, Vox Lux ultimately signifies very little."
rotten," A remarkably flaccid effort -- much lamer than its predecessor, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, which was pedestrian and sleazy but hit its marks."
rotten," Suffers from acute sequelitis. The characters aren't as vibrant, the dialogue isn't as witty and the action isn't as fresh as they were the first time around."
fresh," Efficiently manufactured and enjoyable enough but overloaded with action and effects, and sorely lacking the magic that marked the first movies in the franchise. "
rotten, Green Zone weakens its claim to authenticity with fictional fudgings. And the weakening works both ways.
fresh," As with many sequels, Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 takes every single thing (and I mean every tiny detail) audiences enjoyed about the first film and turns it up to 11."
rotten," Director Tom McGrath and team deliver some keen observations on growing-family dynamics and a number of laughs, but they run out of story a while before putting this one to bed."
rotten," Cruising into cinemas with worse timing than a Taiwanese Rolex, this chick flick about one woman racking up five figures of credit card debt seems less like a comedy than an epic 104-minute finger-wagging session."
fresh," Like Father, Like Son uses a well-worn plot device as a springboard to explore the meaning of family and fatherhood in an age and a society where guilty parents struggle to achieve a healthy life/work balance."
rotten," Wilson is a very capable comic actor, but he's given very few notes to play here. The character he's playing is subject to the whims of the writers, and there's just nothing he can do with the material."
rotten," There's little in Billy Shebar's script, the rambling direction by theater and opera helmer Chen Shi-Zheng - or Liu Ye's impassive performance as the student."
rotten, The movie is always engaging but not quite convincing.
rotten, Full Throttle is silly in the extreme and works best for audiences who are as undiscerning as its creators.
fresh," Once the film acknowledges the exaggeration and two-dimensionality of the story's gleefully villainous characters, 'Les Mis' starts to resemble a party with great music."
rotten," As much a poor man's ""Hot Shots"" if ever they were"
fresh," The funniest, most deliciously venomous Jane Austen movie ever made, and conclusive proof that, a) Kate Beckinsale has been seriously undervalued by the movies and, b) Whit Stillman is a major, distinctive talent."
fresh," With violent skirmishes and acts of self-sacrifice, actions speak louder than words in this simplistic but effective patriotic epic."
fresh," If nothing else, it will make you see the film in a whole new light."
fresh," It's also a sad rumination on how destructive World War I was to the people who survived it, as well as a scathing indictment of misogynistic legal practices that allow women to suffer in order to obtain the desired results."
fresh, It looks beyond the wild-child rock-chick cliche to find different shades of Joplin.
fresh," That this sentimental journey is structured as well by the game show connects this jaunty thriller with Boyle's dazzling opus on consumers and/as addicts, Trainspotting."
rotten," Post-traumatic hitman disorder afflicting an existential assassin slacker doing down time in Italy without a Mafia in sight, and the standard male screen fantasy of reciprocal hooker romance as high price tag stranger sex blossoms. Eat, Slay, Love."
rotten," This rotor movie's rote in places, too talky, and overstuffed with characters. Worst of all, one 'copter is a stereotypical Native; second-worst is Dipper, the main female character, a dippy, clingy, quasi-stalker type. "
rotten," Another sorry chapter in Hollywood's infatuation with video games, Doom is basically a deadly dull rehash of Resident Evil, which in turn was a third-generation clone of Aliens."
fresh, Many movies lose their luster over time. Toy Story just gets better with age.
fresh, Veteran is like Beverly Hills Cop remade with the young Jackie Chan. Masterfully mixes hardcore action with a sense of playfulness.
fresh, James White is at times so bleak and bracing that many will find it tough to endure.
rotten," No one expects low-budget horror sequels to be the height of innovation. But it's still a shame, because it left a talented director without much to work with."
fresh," A lot of fun, highly original and the most entertaining action sci-fi to hit our screens for many years."
rotten," If Brunt's film sounds puerile, it advertises that quality in its title. If its humour is strictly gutter level, it acknowledges its trash status through a fixation on fetishes & faeces. Adult babies in the audience will likely be gurgling with glee."
fresh," The fear-loaded, dehumanising, homicidal imperative dramatized here remains, the apparent recruiting qualification for large swathes of the American Law Enforcement Community."
rotten," There's a beating human heart at the origin of the Sex and the City behemoth, but this unwelcome, undignified sequel does everything it can to bury it."
rotten," Absent the two superlative performances, there is nothing to recommend the picture."
fresh," Director Gabe Polsky's tremendous documentary is Fetisov's story, but it is also a penetrating indictment of the Cold War practices of the Soviet Union and its mistreatment of some of the greatest athletes in history."
fresh," Kristen Wiig is the best sketch comic alive, and ""Bridesmaids"" should finally make her a movie star."
rotten," If this earnest and forgettable road movie represents a meaningful tribute to taking pictures, we ought to go back to cave drawing."
fresh," This is an above-average, young love weeper that somehow manages to hit all the genre notes in formal succession - yawn - but holds your interest by the remarkably nuanced performances of leads Stenberg and Robinson."
fresh," Pure summer movie magic - literally. More fun than Ocean's 11, 12 and 13 combined. You won't believe you eyes - and that's the point."
rotten," Wells sacrifices flair to fidelity. Letts is one of the most formidable talents around today, but in handling his screenplay with such kid gloves, Wells puts a passenger in the driver's seat."
rotten, Gomez-Rejon's The Current War is unfortunately neutralized by Mitnick's artless script.
fresh," What really holds this together is Wahlberg's low-key, firmly internalized performance as a man torn between his loyalty to the clan and his responsibility to himself."
fresh," Even if you care very little for fancy food and the people who make it, The Last Magnificent works as a portrait of a man who leaves aromatic clouds of glamour wherever he goes."
rotten, The film is bloated and unfunny... and is plagued by a boringly retrograde notion of pan-Asian-ness while conveniently escaping the burden of casting any actual Asians in its principal roles.
rotten, the lingering impulse is to take sides and wish violence upon others. I like to think that that couldn't have been the intention.
fresh," This one does its bloody job fairly well, but it'll be interesting to see what Wan and Whannell are able to achieve when they get a bigger budget."
rotten," I was amused. I wasn't exactly enthralled, but that's nothing to be surprised about when attending a film based on a 9-minute television skit."
fresh, A first-rate doc about the unsung Latino Bob Dylan who brought the spirit of American civil rights and Vietnam War anti-establishment protests to South Africa's fight against apartheid.
rotten," Without action, compelling characters or a coherent point of view, Edge of Darkness doesn't have a glimmer of good qualities."
fresh, Make time for this one.
rotten, Kimberly warns that 'every war has its casualties' - you pick a fight with her and you're gonna be on that 'notify my next of kin' list... wickedly funny.
rotten," Like its titular character, A.X.L is a pastiche of familiar parts constructed in a lab, a blend of science-fiction and extreme sports tropes that result in little more than an audition reel for the film's young stars."
rotten," Admirable attempt at independent feature animation is undercut by videogame-quality CGI, cardboard characters and a bludgeoningly allegorical, unimaginative story of tribal conflict and teenagers in love."
rotten," Even in the avalanche of terrible Hollywood romantic comedies, this one is particularly inane."
rotten, More than a little bit embarassing.
rotten," Safe House exemplifies the kind of mediocre movie Hollywood pushes into the January-February release slot. It's nothing you haven't seen elsewhere, and it's not as good - even with Denzel's impish smile."
fresh," Writer-director Andrew Dominik takes his time with the story, but his languorous pacing allows tension to build -- and permits the actors, Affleck in particular, to add nuance and depth to characters who'll seem familiar only at first glance."
fresh," It's a phenomenal artwork but, for all its solar flares, it's cold to the touch."
fresh," Overall, Chicago earns that highest of praises -- I can't wait to see it again."
rotten, When Bad Things Happen to Stupid People might have been a better title.
fresh," A lot of sports-themed films put a heroic, inspirational spin on the proceedings. You cheer, shed a few tears, and move on. That's so not ""Gleason."""
rotten," What's really incredible is how far this film goes to avoid the ideas, feminist and otherwise, embedded in its premise."
fresh, The acting alone is worth the price of admission.
rotten," All of the prettiest pictures of mother nature couldn't save To The Wonder from being a lifeless, overly-poetic bore that fails to keep a consistently flowing story intact."
rotten," The Fourth Kind delivers a handful of decent shocks but it's ultimately let down by a weak plot, some patchy performances and the fact that the fictionalised reconstruction element doesn't really work."
rotten, I stared with glazed eyes at The Bounty Hunter. Here is a film with no need to exist.
fresh," A breezy, fun watch that's quick to put a smile on your face, almost at the expense of dramatic heft or realism."
fresh," [It] entertains here, surprises there, and on the whole a clear improvement over 2011's The First Avenger."
rotten," If you come to Tintin with preexisting affection for the franchise, it might be easier to ... overlook the dull plot, slow to develop characters and miscalculated humor"
fresh," Whether or not you've studied piano, or any musical instrument, it is fascinating to observe Bernstein's gentle but rigourous technique in correcting errors, training the musicians' bodies, and helping them to locate their own place within the piece."
fresh, As a solidly entertaining piece of trashy exploitation its only drawback is a PG-13 rating.
rotten, The film ... seems uncertain of its own unusualness as Linklater eventually opts for a piece that is little more than a road movie and its rhythm stalls.
rotten," Relies heavily on its namesake's demonic appearance, praying that gloomy visuals, a gothic setting and routine jump-scares will evoke enough unease in a movie that tests patience even with its concise running time."
fresh," The heart of this top-drawer thriller about greed, family politics and dirty business lies in the lack of one in its central character, superbly portrayed by 87 year-old Christopher Plummer.. Plummer alone is good reason to see the film."
rotten, Only a fine performance from Pfeiffer and a couple of decent lines from Bates made it bearable.
rotten, The movie falters with an inconsistent tone.
fresh, Makes you feel like you're reading a great compendium of short stories in which vibrant images literally burst from the pages.
fresh," [Frank Marshall] isn't exactly a cinematic poet, but he does a fine job delineating each individual dog's personality, as well as the shifting hierarchy of power within the pack."
rotten, It's so escapist it escapes even from itself.
rotten," Not unlike Ali MacGraw in the equally apocryphal Love Story, the closer our heroine inches toward death's door, the more physically attractive she becomes. Phooey!"
fresh," Lively and enlightening, this truth-is-stranger-than-fiction caper takes an ironic, satirical, even shallow tone."
rotten," Blended-family sequel has crass humor, iffy messages. "
rotten," By the end of The New World all I had were flashbacks to Mystery Science Theater as I hissed at the screen, Tom Servo style, ""End! End!"""
rotten, Buddy comedies usually need two people willing to do something for a laugh to really work - one guy trying twice as hard really isn't enough.
rotten, I have no problem with violence in the movies but it needs to have some kind of purpose.
rotten, It's like flipping through five years of dog calendars.
fresh," 'Strange Weather' is a fairly solid chronicle of the grieving process, but an even better performance showcase for the tremendous Holly Hunter."
fresh, A thought-provoking film with heart about the developing friendship between two interns at a Paris hospital
rotten," Some questions just can't be answered by science, and the quandary of why Creation is so poundingly dull is one of them."
fresh," ...the pace is better, the action is not flooding the screen every two seconds, and characters seem more like evolved concepts rather than background distractions."
fresh," The Force Awakens leans heavily on the original Star Wars, and that's comforting for fans, though one hopes [Episode VIII] will take more risks."
fresh," With this confident drama, J.C. Chandor (Margin Call, All Is Lost) continues to evolve as a filmmaker, giving the mob movie a remarkably thoughtful twist with vivid characters and situations. "
fresh," Both ""Ida"" and Ida are exquisite."
rotten, It's a mess; it's pretentious; it is thundery with dismay. 
rotten, A film victim of a strong intention of its filmmakers to address a crisis of values and the consequences of not having communication between parents and children. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh," The movie, uneven as it is, has terrific momentum and passages of concentrated visual beauty. The acting is strong even when the script wanders into thickets of rhetoric and mystification."
fresh, Ric Burns' absorbing four-hour critical biography of the seminal pop artist is devoted to the proposition that Warhol was the greatest artist of the second half of the 20th century.
rotten, Rendition grabs hold of a super-charged subject and squeezes all the life out of it.
fresh," Insanely violent, ludicrously gory and probably as much fun as you'll have in a cinema this year."
fresh, Its emotional core makes it easy to appreciate as a classical (if not classic) entertainment. 
fresh, What do you get when you let Danny Boyle put his spin on a fact-based cross of Cast Away and Into the Wild? An exhilarating episode of 'Who Wants to Be a Slumdog Mountaineer?' 
rotten, ...bad films are common enough that it's probably worth making distinctions between the unwatchable and the guilty pleasure.
fresh," Brisk, occasionally snarky and genuinely fun."
fresh," Even though everyone watching knows exactly what the film is building towards, the climactic sequence delivers everything you want and more (especially if you're afraid of heights)."
fresh, Could move President Bush's attention far to the east of Iraq.
rotten," Goyer also wrote all three Blade films, so character misunderstandings can't be blamed for the two half-realized plot lines crammed into one feature."
fresh," ...sticks pretty close to the formula of its predecessor, but it's saved by its sly humour, with digs flying thick and fast."
rotten, Perhaps Zero would have been a better name.
fresh, Watts and Company give us a new Parker and a new Spider-Man entirely sufficient to the task of course-correcting and extending the webslinger's adventures on the big screen.
rotten, Delivers its message with unfortunate directness
rotten, Every so often Kapur shoots from behind a huge stone column or pillar; most of these pillars exhibit more personality than the movie.
fresh," When I saw this film I was reminded of a documentary film I saw last year called 'The House I Live In' which explores the disaster of America's War on Drugs. Based on a true story, 'Snitch' explores some of the same issues."
fresh, ... it's the way that Fanning and Englert animate their characters that makes the movie special.
rotten," Given the story is based on reality, it's understandable why the makers of 6 Below didn't want to throw in embellishments, but a bear attack really wouldn't have gone amiss."
rotten," By covering so many events in one go, Ross's episodic and exhausting history lesson wastes the remarkable story of Knight's wartime escapades."
fresh," LaBute's observations about our self-destructive obsession with appearances may not be original, but his ability to create articulate, provocative characters is."
rotten," Revolutionary Road is a dumbed down movie. But it's not dumbed down for just general audiences; it's dumbed down for would-be intellectual audiences, people who are supposed to like books. It sorely fits contemporary times."
fresh," Almost hypnotic in its power, it's a film that washes away all the parodying it has received over the years, emerging as fresh and startling today as it did nearly 50 years ago."
rotten," Valentine's Day is a passing nod to love, like a box of chocolates or flowers that soon wilt. It's star-studded amiable fluff with no real value, but it's kind of a tickle if you're in the mood."
rotten," Even while being admirably faithful to so much of the novel's language, Luhrmann and Pearce still can't quite maneuver Carraway's more cautionary contours about America."
fresh," Tom Cruise's ego-driven ""Look at me; aren't I heroic?"" performance detracts, but it's just too compelling and the other performances too pitch-perfect for this to ruin things."
fresh," Hugely moving and even, at times, terrifying, this is, without a doubt, the best mainstream American pic of the year thus far - gasp!"
rotten, If you take away the shocking makeup-effects work of KNB EFX Inc. there's not much there at all.
fresh, Sisters is an uneven mix of raunchy farce and sincerity that's elevated by the undeniable chemistry between Tina Fey and Amy Poehler.
rotten," A 3D ball of energy, but its furry characters are flatly run-of-the-treadmill."
rotten," Screenwriters Mark Schwahn, Marc Hyman and Jon Zack can't decide whether they want Perfect Score to be funny or serious, with the result that it falls short of being either."
rotten," Like many of Scott's latter-day films, The Martian is engaging to a degree but seems flimsier the more you think about it."
fresh, The best biopic you're likely to see this year won't be coming to a theater near you.
fresh," Sometimes there's nothing to be done about death except laugh at it, which is exactly what the comedy Kingdom Come does, with most of the right laughs in most of the right places and some unexpected ones thrown in."
fresh," The Big Sleep is the best scripted, best directed, best acted, and least comprehensible film noir ever made."
rotten," Life in the OASIS is exciting and wondrous to behold through your avatar's oversized anime eyes, but it doesn't mean much without some real-world stakes, and that's where the film stumbles, badly."
rotten, The film isn't willing to completely face the bleakness of its allegory faith versus skepticism. 
fresh, Clever space adventure with dazzling special effects. 
fresh," Naomi and Clive burrow into the swanky sewage of global conspiracies by capitalist assassins and devious suits, in league with diversifying mobsters worldwide. Sobering details effectively spiced up, and with leading man libidos firmly in check."
fresh, A guaranteed good time for any member of the family ... easily this year's best animated movie.
rotten," An extended ""in my day"" joke intended to convey the superiority of old people over a lot of supposedly contemporary behavior that doesn't actually exist in real life."
rotten, ...a throwaway thriller...Serra conjures up a pseudo-sizzling frightfest that's not imaginative enough to force a dead tick off a shaggy dog's hind leg.
fresh," Challenge all viewers and gives them plenty to ponder after the credits roll, the lights go out and they reach the parking lot."
rotten," Some very funny moments, but sequel to the 2001 comedy is mostly an uninspired exercise in recycling."
rotten," Watching The Prestige is like observing a magic act where the magician's sleight-of-hand isn't deft enough. The trick almost works, but not quite."
fresh, There's a deeper meaning to Akash Sherman's Clara as the film begs of us to ask if life exists beyond the Earth.
fresh, The Addams Family-Beetlejuice-Monkey Bone loving lot of you should RUN to this spectacular outrageously brave kaleidoscopic colorburst of a mindtripilous film. Not for kids...
rotten," The film is unable to specify narrative urgency beyond a broad sense of ""based on a true story"" pathos that's by turns hollowly uplifting and tragic. "
rotten, How much fun you have will depend on your tolerance for a diet of non-stop swearing and filthy innuendo. The voice cast don't just rain down f-bombs. They lob in a good few c-grenades for good measure too.
fresh," Quite simply, the greatest film about a jazz musician ever. Do not miss this story of a career cut short by a ""Frankie and Johnny"" tragedy."
rotten," A pointless sequel with barely any humor, a drab plot, and a concept that is so derivative, it really angered me."
rotten," Director Ken Scott stresses the movie's dude-centric outlook, playing up the anxieties of impending fatherhood, and neglects any sort of maternal perspective, which dumbs down an already moronic premise."
rotten, The tone is uneven and more often morose than joyful. The pacing is slow and at times almost tedious. The end result is something that feels like it was put together from a jumble of Disney clichés tacked onto the skeleton of Beauty and the Beast.
rotten," By the end, even the beautiful Elisha Cuthbert starts to look repulsive."
rotten," Like most Jerry Bruckheimer-produced hot-weather epics, it's big, loud and as empty as a loan shark's conscience."
fresh," It often seems as though Gilliam is the least prolific of fantastic directors working today (with the possible exception of Alejandro Jodorowsky), but once again, it was worth the wait."
rotten, A lost opportunity that fails to become a beautiful defeat. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten, Gibney tends toward that dutiful doc style that mixes talking heads and archival clips into a flavorless stew -- a bland complement to Fela's zesty on- and offstage presence.
rotten," In the end, the trouble with Eight Legged Freaks is you'll find a lot more laughs in the pictures that inspired it."
rotten," Saw IV almost makes you believe there are hundreds of rooms out there at this very minute with puppets, tricycles, and audio tapes just waiting for the next game."
rotten, Although it lacks originality it plays a little better than the silly title suggests.
fresh," As a brash, showbiz-y digest of blues roots and culture, it's lovingly designed and performed in the right spirit, finding as much to cherish in a Cadillac's tailfin as in a risqué rhyming couplet."
rotten," This comedy drama is capably acted and undeniably touching in spots, although less than two weeks after seeing it, I can remember having been undeniably touched but not much else."
fresh," Even if The Matrix Revolutions fails to mesmerize your mind, it will dazzle your senses."
rotten," A tedious, strictly superficial fright-flick...."
fresh, Entertaining and wonderfully satisfying.
rotten," An odd, stilted production that is nearly too contemporary in its flippant sentiments for its own good. "
fresh, A splashily diverting documentary which will be catnip to Golden Age Hollywood fans and deeply informative to the general public.
fresh," It starts too slowly and suffers from weak dialogue and less-than-epic acting. But as popcorn movies go, this is the year's popcorniest."
rotten," Glass betrays the elegant narrative of Unbreakable and James McAvoy's command performance from Split. Pedantic, dreary, dunderheaded, as bloodless as its ideas and lethally verbose. It is the worst possible sequel outcome."
rotten," A Dog's Purpose works best when you don't pay attention to its pseudo-philosophical musings or emotional manipulation, but let the images of adorable dogs guide you into an innocuous stupor."
fresh," Como todas as obras de Fincher que se calcam na razão, é uma produção envolvente, inteligente e intrigante."
fresh," ...the best cinematic rendering of a Grisham novel ever, which is either saying a quite lot or very little at all, depending upon your view of things Grisham. "
rotten," The film as a whole is a failure, but additionally, it's also a mess of unedited or badly edited scenes."
fresh, Lanthimos has an eye for the grotesque that suits overt comedy even better than it does quirky horror.
rotten," Despite its lofty aspirations and late 16th century setting, this one belongs right up there with Showgirls in the high-camp section of your local video store."
rotten," 'Indie' is a marketing label that gives lazy films credibility. 'Martha Marcy May Marlene' is the perfect example. Every flaw can be summed up with: 'Well, it's an indie!'"
rotten," It's enough to make one very curious about where co-directors Marcus Romer and Kit Monkman will go next. Hopefully, to classes in how to handle actors."
fresh," You know how it goes: the plot is inane, but a lot of the dialogue makes you laugh."
rotten," Gus Van Sant assumiu um trabalho ingrato: quando as cenas funcionam, em seu filme, a responsabilidade é de Hitchcock. Quando falham, a culpa é sua."
fresh," Some of its best scenes are its most absurd ones, in which Plummer's Getty behaves with a grotesque meanness."
rotten, The director finds himself artistically stranded between the allegorical impulse and the will to historicize.
fresh," Of its kind, The Bourne Supremacy is incredibly skilled -- much more exciting than its predecessor."
rotten," This send up of the Paranormal Activity films provides a few laughs here and there, but for the most part its crude and clichéd script is ridiculously stupid, embarrassingly over the top and occasionally offensive."
fresh," ""Mary and Max"" dares to be equally funny and sad, making it as bittersweet as Max's favorite chocolate."
fresh," A cross between Kiwi rugby documentary The Ground We Won and an Aussie outback horror film, Hotel Coolgardie is a compelling yet chilling watch."
rotten," Director Gaby Dellal's 3 Generations encourages its audience to look at the transgender community with a humane and compassionate eye, but her film will probably reinforce more perspectives than it changes."
rotten," If the result is problematic, we need more people like Besson to push the envelope and refuse to adhere to the current sequelitis infesting the industry. The fact that he decided to take this risk should be acknowledged."
fresh," It accepts that there are thousands of people in Hollywood who can wield CGI like Harry Potter's wand, so why not put the next chapter of Spider-Man in the hands of someone who's more comfortable with humans than with computers?"
rotten," A Walk in the Woods takes only minimal effort to watch, and leaves you with nothing much worth remembering. "
fresh," This is one of the most assured, fully-formed British debuts of recent years."
fresh," A gloriously entertaining, sincere and often bordering on brilliant mess that is probably going to flop financially but gain a devoted cult following in the process ..."
rotten," At its core, the movie is a formulaic coming-of-age story about a precocious son trying to prove his worth to his overbearing absentee father, as well as a predictable tale of wilderness survival against the odds."
fresh, ... the sensitivity of the director is remarkable. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten, The setup is great; the payoff leaves you more than a little bit disappointed.
rotten," What we are left with is a higher body count and a faster pace, but no tension. ...Welcome to the low-impact world of modern franchise horror pictures."
fresh," A story of survival, of assimilation - and of alienation."
rotten," Too much Jersey Shore, not enough piranhas."
rotten," Fright fans more interested in thematic depth than visceral thrills may appreciate what writer-director Michael Petroni attempts, but even they'd likely admit there's not much to savor."
rotten," Most of the movie has the cruddy lighting and generic, death-by-franchise atmosphere of a third-rate spectacle that's been worked over by too many hacks."
fresh, a masterpiece of psychological drama coupled with a darn fine action flick that uses the classic western as its idiom. And then turns it on its head.
rotten, The loosely tied latest entry into The Conjuring universe suffers from an anemic script with too little scares and an underappreciation for who would likely be its core audience.
rotten," Though the events are gruelingly (and graphically) recreated there's a typical lack of emotional connection which might be forgivable in a thriller but utterly hobbles this supposed cri de coeur. An almost total failure then, but a noble one."
rotten," The visuals are all there -- if films got prizes for best poster, this one would be a shoo-in. But story, heart and purpose all seem to be lost at sea."
rotten," Despite the presence of Helen Mirren, this is a dull, plodding horror film that could have easily taken place in any house and it really wouldn't have made any difference."
fresh," Skilled direction, a talented cast and a simple but elegant story will garner a lot of sympathy from its targeted, more mature audience. "
rotten," Russell Crowe's sweating and facial tics are always entertaining, but Ron Howard never lets you enjoy them, so busy is he directing everyone into a state of uplifting bliss."
rotten," A safe-as-milk, toy-ready, born-to-cross-promote piece of animated Hollywood product that will likely please children but leave adults dreaming of The Incredibles."
rotten, Late-period Eastwood that lacks the earnest introspection that defined his earlier works.
rotten," This dreadful comedy starts from a rotten premise and goes downhill with a series of unfunny sketches, crass product placements and roles that degrade those who have ill-advisedly taken them."
rotten," Though these dialogues are worthy, the medium doesn't seem right for the message."
rotten, The laughs are sporadic and the concept is too detached from reality to yield any nostalgic resonance.
rotten," The movie lurches from one gross-out scene to another, flipping the bird at continuity and logic. It honestly seems as if Sandler and his team descended on a random suburb, halfheartedly improvising and moving on when they got bored."
rotten," A poorly conceived film that is interesting enough to be entertaining, but certainly not good enough for a recommendation. "
fresh, The bottom line is this: the movie works. It works extremely well and it does so because of Downey.
rotten," They never elevate Tooth Fairy above bland and predictable, which is a horrifying fact given you have two of the most charming and beloved screen stars of all time in the movie (Julie Andrews and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson)."
rotten," ""The Prime Ministers: The Pioneers"" takes on a vast subject - the history of the modern state of Israel - from a disappointingly narrow perspective."
fresh," The Good Dinosaur is one of Pixar's most gorgeous films to date, and it's an awe-inspiring achievement in the increasing spectacle and photorealism of computer animation"
rotten," all the pieces are in place for a great thriller - and then, just like your typical Yuletide get-together, it all falls a little flat."
rotten," Movies should invite viewers in, taking them on a journey together with the characters on-screen. Unfortunately, ""Life Itself"" is less journey than lecture."
rotten," The first ""Point Break"" rode the big kahuna; this one's a wipeout."
rotten," The violence is cyclical, no one learns anything, and any points gained for absurdism are lost by landing too many punches square on the nose."
fresh," There's little doubt that Schumer is a star in the making with a point of view and plenty to say. But as a star vehicle, Trainwreck could have done with going off the rails a little more to compliment her talent."
rotten," As feared, this wretched story nullifies everything positive about 'Fifty Shades Of Grey.'"
fresh," Not every joke lands, especially if you're outside of the 18-year-old boy demographic. But for every tepid gag or cringeworthy goof, there's a seriously catchy song to more than make up for it."
fresh," Lapses in narrative cohesion are easily more forgivable than lapses in heart, talent and intelligence, which are all things The Tree of Life has in spades."
fresh," Like 2016's surprise hit The Shallows, The Wall proves you can achieve a lot with very little. "
fresh," Going to Japan for this movie was a smart move by the filmmakers. Not only does it provide new backdrops for the races, but the F&F movies (as their fans call them) have drawn a huge international fan base."
fresh," Though it obviously concentrates very skillfully on a particular time and place, it also points to larger global issues that should make us all stop and think."
rotten," Payne has taken a giant of American acting and awakened a midget in him -- a miserable, grumpy bore who seems to deserve his pipsqueak destiny."
rotten," It'll take more than a group of Argentinian cops to crack exactly what the metaphor is, as any definable cultural, political or literal meaning behind the case is buried under layers of monotonous characters talking in laboured whispers. "
fresh," Horton Hears a Who! doesn't enter the live-action realm, which is a good thing, but the lengthened result has its own charm and is enjoyable in a family-friendly sort of way, even if it feels a little like Dr. Seuss by way of Ice Age."
fresh," It hits you as fact; the director's fiercest gift is not to invent the future, as a plausible dream, but to report on it as if it already existed"
fresh, There is hardly a false moment here.
rotten," Even if it doesn't make you laugh, the movie executives will, all the way to the bank."
fresh, A virtuoso ensemble piece to rival the director's Nashville and Short Cuts in its masterly interweaving of multiple characters and subplots.
rotten, There's nothing wrong with its signals but the manoeuvres still need L-plates.
rotten, I don't buy the notion that this is all a lavish fantasy to cheer us in troubled times. It's too clueless and condescending for that.
rotten, It's called Let Me In. That demanding title says something about how the gentle poetry of the original gets lost a bit in Reeves' translation.
rotten, Smith's quest is the worst kind of sentimental gimmick: He's like Oskar Schindler and Oprah rolled into one. But credit Smith and Pursuit Of Happyness director Gabriele Muccino for keeping the tone solemn and muted.
rotten, A cloying mixture of whimsy and sentiment.
rotten," Yes, it's time for another visit to the Adam Sandler Death-of-Cinema Fun Factory, the big-screen version of a terrible sitcom where laugh tracks are replaced by the co-stars chuckling at their own awful material."
rotten, ...a failed cinematic experiment...
rotten," Taking a production pretty much intact from stage to screen robs it of its surprises. The cast seems to know what's coming, and so do we. There's not a single moment where you sense 'discovery' taking place."
rotten, Bohemian Rhapsody is made up almost entirely of contrived biopic signposts - a Queen's 'Greatest Hits' of ah-ha moments.
fresh," High in gloss if not necessary insight, this is manna for fashion fans but a marginally slighter piece of work than The September Issue."
fresh, A densely atmospheric portrait of disaffected youth by artist-filmmaker Daniel Peddle that flouts preconceived notions at every unconventional turn.
rotten, Every single joke in this movie is telegraphed so far in advance that you can figure out the punchlines long before they actually arrive.
rotten," Reynolds's underlying sweetness takes the edge off the comic's homicidal self-pity, though the endless shtick has a miss-to-hit ratio of about three to one."
rotten," Cruise and Diaz have worked together before, but this is their first summer-movie pairing, and their star qualities are so similar that together, instead of romantic chemistry they generate a sort of giddy, blinding falseness."
rotten," If I see one more high school movie that uses a Literature class Shakespeare lesson as a metaphor for raging hormones and whatever else the screenwriter is trying to put across, I swear I'm going to throttle someone."
rotten," The whirring sound you hear is that of Neil Simon, screenwriter of the 1972 film on which this is louchely based, spinning in his retirement."
fresh," One of the definitive mystery chillers of all time. Poignant, beautiful and devastating."
fresh," Hall really gets under the skin of the character, offering a complex portrait of a woman who seems to be constantly on the verge of a breakdown."
fresh," More pretty good, if forgettable FX-driven franchise fodder...proficiently directed...also features the ever-surprising Stanley Tucci, who sports the latest in a long line of formidable movie wigs."
rotten," For the truest proof that love is blind, see ""Mistress America."" There's no other reason to do so."
rotten," It's a shame Australia's Spierig Brothers opt to turn it into just any old noir-future chase movie - roughly Blade meets Minority Report, without the production flair."
rotten," Pride and Prejudice and Zombies may have seemed like an interesting idea on paper, but when trying to combine these two elements on film, it makes for a narratively-befuddled experience in which they only get in each other's way."
fresh," The Others is that most atypical of Hollywood productions: it is magnificently understated and dedicated to earning its reactions through that holy cinematic trinity of script, direction, and performance."
rotten, A sequel that is located well below the very popular original comedy. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh," Finding an enthralling equilibrium between hard numerical data and heartrending testimonials, Dick masterfully weaves together both the expert statements you'd expect in a documentary like this and first-hand accounts from victims."
fresh," Though Love and Darkness has moments of self-conscious artiness, as many first films do, Portman, very sure as to what she wanted, has made certain not to overstate the story's potent emotions, and that has made the difference."
fresh, An interesting mess for older teens and up.
fresh," It is a shame the film isn't more ambitious than it is, but that doesn't mean you can't respect what it does accomplish."
fresh," Tarantino's latest exercise in comedic nihilism rates an A- for audacity. Full of signature tropes, this sanguinary oater owes equal debts to Leone, Agatha Christie ... Flawed, startlingly revelatory, another notch for the gunslinger-arrogant auteur. "
fresh," A delicately detailed immersion into the world of Z-grade Italian horror cinema that ultimately may or may not be a horror film itself ... a tense, teasing triumph."
rotten, Magical mystical nonsense.
fresh," Certainly interesting and aware, and if one can get past Matthew's snoozy, aggressively detached demeanor, it might actually achieve a moderate sense of importance."
rotten, Is it fun? Sort of. But it shoulda coulda been a ton of fun.
fresh," Mushrooms, food and romance collide in Jason Cortlund and Julia Halperin's modestly charming indie debut."
fresh, The highest compliment I can pay Spotlight: I would watch this on TV.
fresh," The Big Sick turns out to be more than a boy-meets-girl tale. The story that announces itself as an interfaith, interracial romance turns out to be an intergenerational -- and healing -- one as well."
rotten, The promise of the borderline-priceless early scenes with Amandla Stenberg as the 10-year-old Cataleya aren't quite fulfilled by the more predictable set pieces with the adult assassin.
fresh, It's not a great movie but it didn't deserve more negative than positive reviews and to fail at the box office as it did. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten," Our identification gives way to envy, and [Mitty] is another one of those enchanted people the rest of us can only dream of becoming."
rotten," The narration, presumably from Gallmann's book, must lose something in the translation; in Basinger's solemn readings, it sounds like ersatz greeting-card poetry."
fresh," It should have been something special, and all we got was more of the norm."
rotten, 3:10 to Yuma's sanitized view is flatly middlebrow - even the line readings are delivered to make convenient actor showcase clips on award shows.
fresh," Though its production is humble and its account full of images many won't want to see, the case represents crucial knowledge for Americans concerned with the boundaries of the First Amendment."
rotten, It's all very Hunger Games Lite. 
rotten," Has none of Get Shorty's skill or wit. In fact, it's clear that the people who made this movie do not get Shorty."
rotten," Yogi Bear is aggressively average, but it isn't the kind of children's movie you need to fear. "
rotten, Missing is the narrative and emotional cohesiveness that would likely have led to [Phantom Boy] being [more] engaging and memorable.
fresh," Cooper is terrific as a bipolar depressive ( ... ) and Jennifer Lawrence is quite fearsome as Tiffany. Unfortunately, there's also something off-balance about the whole enterprise which repeated American football references will not correct in the UK."
rotten," The movie could have been saved, though, if it had cut the puns of the kind that made us all flee Batman and Robin."
rotten," If you only take your children to see movies like Up ... they'll think every film is going to be fantastic. That's not very good training for the disappointments of life, so Furry Vengeance does have one purpose."
fresh," Pro-military battle film with a lot of graphic violence, blood and awful wounds. This tale of savage warfare also begins and ends with acts of noble courage, self-sacrifice, compassion and decency."
fresh, I'm pleased to report [the Brothers Wachowski] pulled it off. And the testicular fortitude required to pull off the film I've just seen boggles the mind.
fresh," This is a hugely entertaining zom-com that's likely to pick up a devoted cult following amongst genre fans, thanks to a winning combination of crudity, gore and laughs."
fresh," Embora não seja engraçado como acredita ser, a honestidade do roteiro em sua frustração com a futilidade contemporânea é algo refrescante em meio a tantos projetos sem personalidade ou ponto de vista."
fresh," ...Even if it misses the mark on the thriller elements, it is at least stylish enough to be watchable."
fresh," Gripping, twist-laden, no-nonsense murder yarn."
fresh, This is truly a film for both parents and children. I really can't find anything wrong with it. Not one thing. It's a beautiful and poignant experience.
fresh," For the generation that grew up thinking of MacMurray as the kindly father-figure on ""My Three Sons"" and Stanwyck as the regal matriarch of ""The Big Valley,"" it's a jolt to see them playing such devious, money-hungry types."
rotten, [Peter Jackson's] efforts to filter or self-edit - assuming there were any - remain fruitless.
rotten," Spurlock clearly had a bug up his you-know-what to out the fast food industry with Super Size Me, but Osama feels far less passionate."
fresh," Star Trek might annoy purists, but everyone else will be glad to see Spock and co. again."
fresh," With each episode produced by its own individual creative team, the lack of continuity can disorientate. But it's this daring mix of styles that gives The Turning its creative energy and distinct off-kilter flavour."
rotten," ""A Hundred Streets"" seems oddly unequal to the status of its charismatic name cast, headlined by Idris Elba and Gemma Arterton."
fresh," Rushmore may have shades of J.D. Salinger's writing and Hal Ashby's movies, but Wes Anderson pulls humor from the trickiest of situations and always manages to surprise."
fresh," Fast paced, engaging, inventive, intelligent and thrilling, Jason Bourne reminds us what a talented director Paul Greengrass is - and what a great script writer, too"
rotten, We're talking dog. Bad dog.
fresh," Although it paints a somewhat idealized portrait of the legendary rocker/political provocateur, The U.S. vs. John Lennon is nonetheless a fascinating, richly detailed documentary."
fresh," If you really listen to Mike White's quirky but ultimately realistic view on life as its dealt out, you'll really enjoy this stellar effort from the burgeoning filmmaking talent."
fresh," Despite the dullness of the main character, there are enough other interesting characters and plot developments to make the story compelling."
fresh, [A] frothily entertaining documentary.
rotten, If the time-travel gimmick has to be employed twice in a row then it's probably best to banish these characters to a retirement sewer.
fresh, Just try to resist Thor: Ragnarok. We double dog dare you.
fresh," Layer Cake is laced with flashbacks and stylistic tics, but it never loses its forward momentum, and to the last shot, it avoids predictability."
rotten, The Crimes of Grindelwald is a tiresome slog - but it ends well.
fresh," Inspired action choreography, macho mentality, aggressive stunt work and nimble editing rule. Despite a few sluggish moments, it had me and it left me all revved up."
fresh, Intense look at gender and relationships is best for adults.
rotten," Adam Sandler seems to just be coasting whatever is left of his career, resigned to the fact that his game was over long ago."
fresh, This is what a star vehicle should be: a well-written project that works without the big names but shines with them.
rotten," A movie that thinks the way to earn our knuckle-biting is to be as dull as hell for 35 minutes, then send a giant shipping container hurtling along the interstate. But you yawn through that, too."
rotten, There's a concerted effort to depoliticize the story... but the movie will find a warm welcome in the red states with its simpleminded tale of brave men doing the right thing while the government falters.
rotten," The clumsy and ineffectual story doesn't do anything but stand in place, whirring."
fresh," However flawed Nair's film may be, it still has so many rewards to offer that it almost seems petty to complain about its problems."
rotten, In which Danny Dyer proves he's a brilliant actor in a heartbreaking work of staggering genius. Just kidding.
rotten," The Predator doesn't quite work because it's never quite clear what it wants to be and, when it finally does snap into focus, it's about the wrong things."
fresh," Marvel Studios is becoming increasingly like Evel Knievel - with every successful stunt it lands, it makes the next one bigger and more difficult."
fresh, Peltola [gives] a deadpan performance that combines the comic gravity of Buster Keaton and the sweet sentiment of Charlie Chaplin.
rotten, The film has been partially dubbed into English with the assistance of the world's worst voice actors. The end product is nearly unbearable to watch.
fresh, Delves into a little-known facet in the life of the iconic leader with an intimacy that is both stark and engrossing.
rotten, Any actual action's an afterthought in this garrulous goof on the classic buddy-cop flick.
rotten, A tighter running time and a better exploration of the broader political context would provide the film a little more kick.
rotten," The Skeleton Key is one of those movies that explains too much while it is explaining too little, and leaves us with a surprise at the end that makes more sense the less we think about it. But the movie's mastery of technique makes up for a lot."
rotten," Unlike Van Sant's grittier, less sentimental recent small films, it's twee enough to make your teeth ache. It's the director's biggest miscalculation since ""Even Cowgirls Get the Blues"" 18 years ago."
rotten," A cliche-ridden exercise that never exhibits any real heart and focuses on characters who never come alive, it also never comes close to living up to the promise of the names in the credits."
fresh," Never has the phrase 'you'll laugh, you'll cry' been more truthful. Families looking for an old fashioned, all-purpose, comedy with heart will flock to this offering that's best described as a canine Terms Of Endearment."
fresh," In all, it's not as stupid as most teen films, but is still only likely to be enjoyed by 17-year-olds who haven't seen Juno."
fresh," Good for lowdown fun, this subversive comedy invites us in to celebrate its idiosyncratic bunch of sweet-natured goons. "
fresh," Hanks' final scene, while being debriefed after his rescue by Navy SEALs, is palpably as emotional and disquieting as any several minutes recorded on film. "
rotten, There's no disguising fluff this fluffy.
rotten," Let's just hope the ""nevermore"" part of Poe's original writing applies to any notion of ""The Raven 2,"" ""Son of the Raven"" or ""That's So Raven the Movie."" (Full Content Review for Parents also available)"
rotten, The fact that the performances are stronger this time doesn't compensate for what is just a hundred minutes of droning nonsense. 
fresh," Finally, Watchmen the movie makes a really good ad for and introduction to Watchmen the book."
fresh," When you add in the ample violence...and the over the top action scenes, Machete makes its case as major escapist entertainment."
fresh," This could be the synopsis of a mediocre ""inspirational"" telemovie, but Nichols is a very deliberate artist, and Loving is as carefully made as anything he has done."
rotten," While some of the performances--Bale's, Dafoe's and Harrelson's for instance--are interesting, they are not enough to elevate this stagnant story. "
fresh, The Death of Stalin is a breath of fresh air and a genuinely great screen comedy. Iannucci conducts the proceedings like the conductor of a great orchestra with an array of virtuosos at his command. 
fresh, I can think of no working director who uses stillness as gracefully and effectively as Takeshi Kitano.
fresh," A big FU to The Fast and the Furious. You won't see a faster, more furious film this year."
fresh," Proving again that he's one of the best actors of his generation, Lucas Hedges shines alongside Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe in this harrowing real-life tale of a gay teen whose parents send him to conversion therapy"
rotten, Castle/the Punisher is not the most charismatic comic book hero at the best of times but Stevenson's jowly pallor and oil slick of hair makes him look more like an Eastern European abattoir worker than a vigilante to be reckoned with.
fresh," Brosnan is credible, Pryce is memorably malevolent, and Yeoh is good if miscast, but Teri Hatcher shoots blanks."
fresh," It's as bright and twinkling as a Christmas tree, decked with warmth and humor."
rotten, Only die hard Jean-Luc Godard fans could appreciate this failed experiment. I am not a die hard fan.
rotten," Undeniably fascinating, but quite tedious once it swallows a grenade in its final act, making it difficult to trust anything writer/director Jill Soloway has to share on the state of the modern American marriage. "
rotten," There are far worse horror movies than Puppet Master: The Littlest Reich, including its inspiration. But even though it's marginally better than the 1989 launch, its competence only goes so far."
rotten," The most disappointing aspect of Jupiter Ascending is, surprisingly, its action sequences."
rotten," It's a big mess, but not without some appealing ideas and performances that manage to survive Yakin's sluggish execution. "
fresh," Writer/director Brad Bird delivers all the thrills and chills of the original picture, while still maintaining the heart that captured us the first go round."
rotten, I hope the series has the good sense to stop with this less- than-convincing beginning.
fresh, The result is a good-natured and good-hearted film that is actually better than the dopey trailers might lead you to otherwise believe.
fresh," While it's better than your average film in a lot of respects, it simply cannot hold up to the legacy of its predecessors."
rotten, An unilluminating remake of George Romero's brilliant and angry 1973 thriller...
rotten," Not quite a romantic comedy, Prime is a hybrid of conflicting tones."
rotten," While I am overjoyed for Ayoade that he has seen such films as Brazil, Eraserhead, The Tenant and the collected works of Aki Kaurismäki, a 90-minute tour of his DVD collection is no substitute for a film."
fresh," ""The Lost City of Z"" is flush with the sort of breathtaking stuff that even the most amazing CGI can't provide. Cinematographer Darius Khondji is the obvious hero, but a lot of the credit goes to the cast."
rotten, San Crash (2005) grammeno ap' to tmima peri metanaston toy amerikanikoy Ypoyrgeioy Eksoterikon
rotten, The term 'unintentional comedy' was coined for a movie such as this.
rotten," There's a decent story trapped somewhere inside that's just waiting to get out, but Tully sadly misses the mark. "
fresh, Richard Goulding was a treat as Boris.
fresh," The best action film of 2014, and probably the best film, period."
rotten," The much-hyped film adaptation, in which James was closely involved, sticks closely to the novel, but is both strengthened and weakened by what director Sam Taylor-Johnson and screenwriter Kelly Marcel decided to omit."
rotten, It's rare to find a movie brimming with this much talent that finds a way to so consistently kill its own narrative momentum.
rotten, The formula is so old that you can almost forgive it. What I couldn't forgive is the soap opera/O.C.-like subplots.
rotten, Million Dollar Arm spoils the Disney sports movie hot streak with the vengeance that David Ortiz does no-hitters.
rotten, Those next to me in the cinema staring blankly at the screen gave a remarkably similar performance to that of Reeves without even being aware of it.
fresh, It's a minor triumph.
fresh," A damning indictment and a call to action - lucid, harrowing and urgent."
fresh," Insidious: Chapter 2 may be somewhat uneven, but at a certain point near the end, I realized I hadn't taken any notes during the second half. For all its weirdness, the film had utterly transported me."
fresh," ... ""Caesar Must Die"" combines documentary, theater, and fiction in ways that could hardly be more au courant."
rotten," Sadly, 'Blindness' may realise its director's worst fear: to produce not only an exploitation B-movie but one, paradoxically, spoiled by its own integrity and misplaced 'artistic' mise-en-scène and intentions."
fresh," ""Killer Joe"" is diabolically dark, and immensely entertaining. "
fresh," There are fine things everywhere you look in this Australian historical drama. Yet, when it's over, you're still thirsty for a better movie."
rotten," Miller conducts an ongoing distraction campaign against his own movie, with explosions of gnarly gore and Nicolas Cage overacting."
rotten," It's surprisingly witless and one-note, so this is only for the truly demented Grinches out there."
rotten," An adaptation of one of his stage plays, Meet the Browns gives off the distinct feeling that Perry is treading water or at the very least is content to satisfy his audience with the minimum."
fresh," This is an utterly adorable, endearing and wonderful all-ages feature that's as much a love letter to the hand-drawn art form as it is to comedy in general."
rotten," I won't really defend Mamma Mia!, but I will recommend how to watch it: Just stop rolling your eyes and listen."
fresh," A tense, well-done thriller, even if underwhelming in various aspects, and fairly forgettable (Splice Today) "
fresh," The screenplay... is overcooked, with outsized emotions and nary any subtly or breathing room, but director Antoine Fuqua adds some vivid gritty cityscapes and intense performances and mostly pulls it through."
rotten," If you choose to watch this movie, you'll be treated to an hour and a half of different versions of the same gag: what if [insert modern thing] somehow existed in Victorian times!?"
rotten," Sickening and utterly pointless, when it's not just outrageously tweaked for shock value, the film is soulless and caters to the darkest of human instincts."
fresh, The thrilling Operation Finale is led by strong performances from Oscar Isaac and Ben Kingsley.
rotten," Gone is any realism, washed away by a camera-friendly cast who wrestle with the piss-poor melodrama when they're not mugging the cameras capturing the prized footage, which must have been plopped down on the porch of whoever used to edit MTV's Fear."
rotten, An overly-familiar story directed with some style but no particular flair. Kiefer Sutherland seems to be having fun doing his best Laurence Olivier impression.
fresh," The sense of looming danger, couched in pregnant pauses and furtive looks, explodes in Sobel's third-act reveal. "
fresh, The film's trump card is its rigorous honesty.
rotten," Aside from a handful of genuinely funny, can't-help-but-laugh moments, though, this trip to the jungle is anything but welcome."
rotten," While Peppermint might come out slightly ahead of other revenge thrillers when it comes to gender politics, it's blatantly racist. "
rotten," There's satire here, or a lazy attempt at it, but the targets are scattershot and the jokes not particularly insightful or funny. "
fresh," Mehta has a painterly eye, giving her images a mythological beauty and tender sensuality."
rotten, A sentimental mixture of patronising farce and cringeworthy platitudes.
rotten," There is so much food, music, dancing and crying that you want to come out, at the end, and find a quiet place to watch paint dry. Unless, of course, you loved MBFGW1 and have spent 14 years waiting for MBFGW2."
fresh, Melville milks the tension for all its worth.
rotten," Kendrick, one of the smartest actresses around, is playing well beneath her abilities. The movie is choking on fumes before it's even had the chance to begin."
rotten," Eat Pray Love has some decent performances and the occasional good moment but it's ultimately let down by a tedious, self-satisfied script, a shocking lack of humour and a criminally indulgent running time."
fresh," a compelling, dangerous meditation on the stifling nature of convention, and the fluid nature of emotional bonding when societal norms are put aside"
rotten, It simply doesn't posses the same sort of testosterone-fueled intensity and bravado that made the filmmaker's earlier effort something of a classic in the action genre.
rotten," ""... equal parts freakish fashion show and tawdry melodrama of the rise and fall of a superficial celebrity."""
rotten," An ordinary drama about addiction and recovery, made somewhat noteworthy by Denzel Washington's firing-on-all-cylinders performance. "
rotten, Poker is still waiting for its defining moment in the cinematic spotlight.
fresh," I am Love, easily one of the most sensual films I have ever seen, is ravishing, an operatic melodrama of stunning beauty and luxuriant texture."
fresh," In the wild, orcas live between 50 and a hundred years. In captivity, it's half that. It's simply a strong argument to free all the Willies."
rotten, Here's a gorefest that also includes a little story line.
rotten," Dreary, anti-septic and overwhelmingly glum, marching down a predictable narrative path without much in the way of enlightening ethical inquiry."
fresh," Dean's finest film, hardly surprisingly in that Ray was one of the great '50s directors."
rotten, Dogs suffers from sloppy editing and expectation which renders the key moments more silly than shocking.
fresh," Under Scott's bravura helming, this sprawling saga, combining the best elements of the classic crime-gangster genre with a fact-based drama of Harlem's drug lord and folk hero, critiques the American Way of Life of mobility, consumerism and success."
rotten," While Team Glum & Glummer clearly deserve each other, their audience deserves much better."
fresh," There are a lot of stale -- and nefarious -- clichés in 8 Mile (Universal), but most of the time they're overwhelmed by the pulsing, grinding, hopped-up camerawork and the soulful star turn of Eminem."
rotten," This empty, misfired epic from M. Night Shyamalan is boring and strengthens the claim that he is the worst director working in mainstream cinema today."
fresh," You may not be limp from accumulated tension when this hunt is over, but its cautiously upbeat global message leaves a satisfying glow and it operates with a crackerjack premise."
rotten," [Smurfs: The Lost Village] is a film that's family-friendly as far as that goes, but ultimately of little interest to anyone other than young children and Smurf completists."
fresh," Black's charismatic, hyperactive, adrenaline-infused performance makes the simple storyline come alive."
rotten," A lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud, violent and mindless."
fresh," Yet another discourse, a creative one, about what people do when they are diagnosed with a terminal disease."
rotten," James is much better than a lot of his contemporaries at this, eschewing over-the-top clowning for actual humanity. But it all gets thrown out the window in the second half. Maybe he'll do better next time."
fresh, Dennis's film attempts something few documentaries have: to inhabit the psyche of its subject.
fresh," While it does fully overcome the demands of transition from stage to screen, ""Fences"" soars on the performances by Denzel Washington and Viola Davis."
rotten, The Force should have been stronger with this one.
rotten," Wish Upon is awful, and even teases a sequel. I wish it into abstract hell"
rotten, In the wake of Taken 2 and 3 we're completely sober to the fact that this veteran vengeance porn has become its own parody. 
fresh," The bottom line is that if you focus on its message, The Giver has some very important things to say. You just might find yourself a little frustrated with the information you get (or rather, don't get) along the way."
fresh," Grim, hard to take, and nightmare-producing, Trade is not for the faint of heart."
rotten," [A] half-baked -- and yes, pointless -- homage."
fresh, a genuinely moving exploration of a complex mother-daughter relationship
fresh," Zombie gore is kept to a minimum, a fact likely to disappoint audiences out for blood. It's a changed Schwarzenegger on view in Maggie, and the change becomes him. "
rotten, Another fan-friendly funny book brought to life...
rotten, Smith Jr looks thoroughly bored by Mom and Pop's extravagant gift. I can't say I blame him.
fresh," The villains of this movie comprise a small army, though their numbers aren't as important as their abilities. But even as they appear unstoppable, their evil plot grows more complex and, at least in one instance, more ridiculous."
fresh," A groovy gross-out with snorts, scares and sentiment, SLiTHER is thus far the must-see frightfully funny movie of the year."
rotten," A deeply ugly film from top to bottom, but more importantly, how can a collaboration between Lohan, Deen, Ellis and Schrader be so dull?"
rotten," Louise Brooks, especially imported for the title role, does not pan out, due to no fault of hers. She is quite unsuited to the vamp type which was called for by the play from which the picture was made."
fresh," It Follows specifically pays tribute to Carpenter's horror precedent in its middle-class setting, its likable characters and its spare, nerve-fraying musical soundtrack."
fresh," An ""all in one night"" crime thriller that's equal parts old-school western and grimly intelligent horror film."
fresh, Instead of prompting me to consider the divide between two groups of people - or even the prejudices of a few particularly sinister police officers - Detroit had me thinking a lot more about notions of institutional power itself.
rotten," Rips off Doc Hollywood, almost note for note."
fresh," Like The Fifth Element, this will grow on people with time ... meant more for discerning moviegoers with strange taste and sensibilities. "
fresh," A neo-screwball hip comedy jazzed up with a classy swing score and a fresh coat of salty, rapid-fire conversations, this midlife Cinderella satire embraces the rude antics of the scandalous UK elite, as world war looms all around their silly, empty heads."
fresh," Fallout is good, but it could have been the best of them all if it had done a better job of keeping its cover. "
rotten," While My Week With Marilyn acknowledges the void between her public persona and private life, it does very little to fill it."
rotten, The film deals with the topic of sexual taboos in a transgressive manner that bends your brain. The whole enterprise may even be fraudulent.
fresh," The film could've benefited from another 15 or 20 minutes of detail and nuance. What's there, though, is strong, thoughtful and disturbing."
rotten," There's something about A Wrinkle in Time overall that doesn't take flight. It doesn't fall to the ground, either, just sort of hovers when it should soar."
fresh," By the end of the film, we learn just about everything about Monroe was self-created, which somehow makes the eventual self-destruction a little more understandable, and her life story a cautionary meditation on the booby-traps of celebrity."
rotten, It might make economic sense for Lionsgate Pictures to carve the novel in two but it means this movie is all built-up with a distinct lack of excitement.
rotten," The film is an uneven action drama, but the message lends it topical relevance."
fresh, One of the absolute best films about surviving High School ever made.
rotten," For all the promise of a cast led by Julianne Moore and David Duchovny in an urbane, adult chronicle of love and marriage, the movie just strings viewers along through phony contrivance, like any other romantic comedy."
rotten, The script is just an excuse to take the characters of the first movie on one of the most pointless road trips in film in recent years. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh, Director Wes Ball and his outstanding young cast work unusually hard to counter the derivative feel.
fresh," Bong Joon-ho remains a filmmaker of sympathetic wit, using often-comic situations to frame the story's intense tragedy and pathos."
fresh," Six years ago, Armando Iannucci's slick and merciless satire might have drawn more blood, but even now it blows away the recent competition with its sharp, sardonic dialogue and uncompromising cynicism."
fresh, A fable with an dreamy atmosphere and a realistic and current message. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh," Light on its feet, deeply human, and fresh in style, this French-Israeli co-production serves up an engaging tale about a group of women struggling with daily life in contemporary Tel Aviv."
fresh," Fear, doubt and vulnerability are intertwined with female strength and determination in [actress Emmanuelle] Devos' solid role. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh," More about humor and hero worship than plot, which is fine, and the movie ambles along mostly at a moderate pace, both a laid-back blessing and its too-lazy curse."
rotten," Saddling two game actors with a tone-deaf, charmless script, the film makes recent J.Lo vehicle The Back-up Plan look like Billy Wilder in comparison."
fresh, MEMORY: The Origin Of Alien is a highly-entertaining slither around the creation myths of the 1979 cinema classic.
fresh," Is it a bit of a letdown? Yes. But so is life, kids. Everything is still pretty awesome."
fresh," If audiences are prepared to sit up straight, take in an opening dialectic, and forgive the understandable shortcomings of some performers, there are many important, fascinating, and devastating truths to be found here."
rotten, Snyder and his crew have made a film for an improbably narrow audience -- I can imagine 12 1/2-year-old boys being enthralled by it -- but they've made it with such skill and care it's more a shame than a failure. 
fresh, A film about history and identity that will long linger in the mind.
rotten," Whatever points Pride and Glory was trying to make have been buried beneath layers of clumsy, good-vs.-bad posturings and peppered with R-rated language that's clearly supposed to remind us of films like The Departed."
fresh," Like Spider-Man before it, Spider-Man 2 is a superhero flick bursting at the seams with big emotions."
rotten," I had decent hopes for this high-concept, low-brow comedy; those hopes were quickly dashed. "
fresh, Perhaps the neatest thing about Phil Grabsky's In Search of Mozart is that after watching it for more than two hours your first impulse is to rush to the Internet and download a slew of Mozart recordings.
rotten," Structurally, the film is a mess: on screen, the novel's digressive, anecdotal narrative seems directionless and muddled."
rotten," Secretariat is a good-natured but thunderingly clichéd triumph-against-the-odds tale, almost every line a cornball aphorism about following your heart."
rotten," It's hard not to wonder if Duvall got passed over for a role in Last Vegas and, not to be outdone by that snake Kevin Kline, decided to make the Western version instead. "
rotten, As usual it's left entirely up to the beleaguered Johnson to make any of it even remotely watchable.
rotten," When Jeff Bridges being thrown under a bus is the best thing a film has to offer, that's when you know that that paved cinematic road ahead of you is going to be unreasonably rough."
fresh, What [Temple] does...is immerse his audience in the spirit of the festival with ingenious editing that shows the Glastonbury Festival as nothing short of a geographically bound society that just happens to exist for a few days a year.
fresh," As is often the case in documentaries like this, absorbing all those details as part of one, tightly edited story gives them an impact they lack when digested in individual pieces over time."
rotten," Sorority Row proves to be just another crass slasher movie, recycling familiar ingredients to diminishing effect."
rotten, Fans of Rick Rosner's 1977-1983 TV show won't find much to pique nostalgia and anyone hoping to revisit the golden days of these earnest troopers may need to lie down for a bit.
rotten, Accompanying adults will be disappointed to see the talents of Lisa Kudrow wasted.
rotten, The John Ford cliches clang against the Sergio Leone sloppy seconds with the hollow ring of a church bell.
rotten," This tone-deaf flick from hack screenwriter Dana Fox, is an example of a Hollywood formula romantic comedy where the author never properly learned the recipe."
fresh, It would seem all but impossible not to have a good time watching Kung Fu Hustle...
rotten," If you're an art student, you'll probably buy the movie on DVD and rub it all over your body."
rotten," With pandering references to the big banks throughout, ""The Commuter,"" has just enough smarts to make its final destination disappointing."
rotten," Even at 82 minutes, Snatched somehow feels long. It's tired, lazy, generic, insubstantial filmmaking that fails to capitalise on its stars. "
rotten," once the fistfights, car chases and stray explosions begin to mount, the movie veers into exponentially dumb overkill."
fresh," It's still inspirational, but does a better job than most Hollywood bio-pics of depicting the smaller, but no less difficult, emotional steps that make up a comeback."
fresh, Visually and musically: smokin'. Dramatically: no cigar.
fresh, There are extraordinary degrees of emotion and intelligence to be found in every word spoken by Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton.
fresh," How can you hate a film that promotes its guitar-pick-thin story with the surprisingly honest advertising tagline, ""Nothin' But a Good Time""?"
rotten," The original was unbelievably cheesy in its special effects but more sophisticated in its concepts, employing real science-fiction writers to work up ideas. Will Ferrell and partners have succeeded in reversing those priorities in this spoof."
fresh, They have saved the best for last. This movie is totally romantic and its three leads are at their best. This will delight 'Twilight' fans and bring in new converts.
rotten, ... undemanding fare for under-sixes and bronies alike.
fresh," Whilst Aquaman is far from perfect, it still delivers an entertaining, vibrant ride and Momoa shows us what DC really stands for - Damn Cool."
fresh," As long as it stays in the air, Red Tails ... is a compelling sky-war pageant of a movie."
rotten," Their mission - for reasons that are not fully explained - is to locate the seven swords of the lost Lords of Narnia, and to use them to save this world from ... something. Uhh, quick a distraction! Look, special effects!"
rotten," A documentary presupposing a surfeit of advance knowledge on its subject, ""Maria by Callas"" is too niche to appeal to anyone outside of the infinitesimal intersection of opera and archival aficionados. It's a diva wrapped in an aria inside an enigma."
rotten," A showy, self-indulgent essay in mourning that's more frustrating than cathartic. "
fresh," Ultimately, I really enjoyed A Hologram for the King, even if I don't think it fully explored the themes it was putting forth."
fresh," It's better than 90% of the animated fare of the last few years. It's refreshing not to have to qualify the movie's appeal by appending the words, 'for the kids'."
fresh," A psychological horror movie of the highest quality, Black Swan features a stunning, career best turn by Natalie Portman."
fresh," For its intended 'tween audience, it's high-decible and shreik-inducing, but it's not recommended for anyone over the age of 30."
rotten," 'Dreams are good,' the Rock learns, 'for everyone.' True, maybe, but never more so than for filmmakers armed with a conceit, lots of PG hijinks and a hunger for your wallet."
fresh, Paradise Lost 3 is perhaps the most interesting and well-made film of the trilogy.
rotten, ...skip this cute-but-unnecessary feature and just watch the seven-minute Oscar-winning short from 1938 instead.
fresh," Audrey Tautou, gives a near flawless performance as an ambitious, unorthodox young Chanel."
fresh, Luis Buñuel creates an eminently classy film that is a splendid piece of escapism for the viewer. Central to this is Catherine Deneuve who oozes such sophisticated sexuality that one becomes utterly immersed in her potentially dangerous adventure.
fresh, Heartbreaker is like a caper comedy meets The Bodyguard -- it's winsome and accomplished fluff.
fresh, The rare follow-up that improves on its predecessor...consistently amusing and sometimes hilarious.
fresh," Like Alfonso Cuaron's wonderful close-space thriller Gravity, Scott's The Martian is all the more interesting because it is linked with possibilities and even probabilities."
fresh, Incredibly entertaining and exactly the antidote for a series of movies that were growing overstuffed beyond the point of exhaustion.
rotten," While its tone and humanity offset the futility of each side's need for one crucial hill, much of this intense, honorable film is too drawn-out."
rotten, What could have been a shatteringly timely piece resonating with the zeitgeist was instead a bit of a damp squib.
rotten," Although loaded with dramatic consequence, ""Life, Above All"" is slight."
fresh, You have to admire [Araki's] sense of style and ambition even if the convoluted narrative begins to grate.
rotten, An overlong horror film with next to no scares and nothing new to add to the zombie genre.
fresh," A funky, fun film version of the famous Marvel superhero concoction."
rotten," Great taste isn't quite the same as great filmmaking, and director Matalqa sometimes lapses into broad humour and even broader melodrama in this generally low-key, wistful tale."
rotten," Thanks to a stupendously inept finale it ends up going nowhere, and by the time it fades to black the only question I had was what could have potentially been changed to salvage it."
fresh, An intelligently inspiring faith-based drama that links the fates of families in Rwanda and Nashville.
rotten," It's a lugubrious, creaky affair, as Williams squishes up his face and droops his shoulders with a coyness that can be downright embarrassing."
rotten, This kindergarten bait is going to flood the boxoffice because of a juvenile hunger for tidbits they can get their hooks into.
fresh," There is very little in the cold, clear air of Brokeback Mountain that isn't first rate [although] its argument may, for many of us, already seem strangely under- and overdone."
fresh," The Cured marks an auspicious debut for Freyne, who showcases an impressive eye for detail."
rotten, Even Ben Stiller looks bored out of his mind.
fresh," Cianfrance uses the film's gritty visuals to enhance the character's experiences, starting with a vibe reminiscent of a 90's thrash metal video clip, then moving into police footage territory before ultimately setting a wistful tone for the third act."
fresh," The well-acted film deals with relevant issues (first love, burden of the Holocaust), but it's too literal, and the second half is a disappointingly pedestrian court melodrama."
rotten," You can do all things right, and fail. Mother!'s irritations are an itch its virtues can't scratch."
fresh, It's a transcendent work of art.
rotten, an exercise in sexual chemistry and fashion
rotten," Despite starting strong, this psychosexual thriller is at once ham-fisted, obvious and all-too-frequently preposterous. "
fresh," The unalloyed joy of seeing one of the greatest actors of all time hamming it up as one of the greatest directors of all time is but one of the delights offered by this cheeky, deeply affectionate pic. "
fresh," The dialogue is witty, the sense of period is spot on and there is also a vulnerability beneath the bluster and bravado of young men enjoying the time of their lives."
rotten," A film like this also needs a great deal of double, triple and even quadruple crossing and confusion to be effective. Yet, it never really utilizes enough of that type of material to create the sort of experience for which it's obviously aiming."
rotten, Bong is so concerned with whodunit that his creaky genre mechanics diminish Kim's determined performance: She's often shunted to the side of the action...
fresh," Woody Allen's easy-to-like but lightweight ""Cafe Society"" serves up just you'd expect from the seasoned writer and director."
fresh," In terms of mere spectacle, Spectre has some wonderful driving stunts, a tremendous introduction for the character played by Christophe Waltz, and a production lavish in glass architecture and supercars."
fresh," While [Alita: Battle Angel] falters in its storytelling and treatment of characters, it's so damn badass and fun that it's worth suffering its flaws."
fresh," On a strictly mechanical level, it all works and if you can adapt to its glum brand of wit, you can extract a few laughs from it. "
fresh, Robert Duvall's excellent performance as a cantankerous rancher makes A Night In Old Mexico a night to remember.
fresh," In one of the best, brightest, most beautifully realised and visually sumptuous tentpole animation films of the year...an absolute joy to behold, as lovingly made a piece of corporate entertainment as you're likely to find at the multiplex."
rotten," The idea of Henson as a cool action hero is something most movie fans can get excited for, but she needed a much better film than this."
rotten," Spike Lee has been erratic at best, misogynist occasionally, but Girl 6 hits a new low."
rotten, Exactly why The Bookshop takes almost two hours to stitch together this threadbare tale is not so much a mystery as it is a miscalculation.
fresh, [Gareth] Edwards has somehow morphed into the best directorial impersonation of a young Steven Spielberg I think I've ever seen.
fresh, Bohemian Rhapsody is one of the best rock dramas I have ever seen. 
rotten," The tone is uneven, the central romance is unconvincing and it's disappointingly low on actual laughs."
fresh, A fun and interesting twist on the travelogue sub-genre of horror ... far better than many horror movies with twice the budget.
rotten," Bohemian Rhapsody fancies itself like the song, ranging a gambit of genres at an inexplicable fashion and expecting its audience to love the certain absurdity of it all."
rotten," A few jolting scares are deployed throughout, but more difficult to shake is how the story's overacting lambs walk a rather programmatic path toward slaughter--or at least anal probing."
rotten," A tell-all chronicle about how this movie came into existence might be more compelling than the film itself, and require angry denials from authorities in response."
fresh, Successfully operates on dual levels -- as a horror movie and as a study of two sisters.
fresh," A pleasing, cliche-averse, stereotype defying tale of mismatched teens in odd-couple love."
rotten," [Writer and director Drew Pearce] flaps around for a consistent tone, stunts some potential story lines and kicks out a bunch of cliches. "
fresh, A compelling but relentlessly downbeat Japanese melodrama.
fresh, A sure sign of a pending apocalypse: I enjoyed Adam Sandler's new movie.
rotten, The International continues in this tradition of telling us what we already know to our sorrow. Somebody tell us something we don't know! 
fresh," Lelio approaches this material with sensitivity and empathy. There's restraint in his style, eloquent as it is."
fresh," The message is clear, if you didn't get it from the rich acting: This is a film to celebrate nature and life."
rotten," Stirring, beautifully filmed and highly personal history of India does right by Salman Rushdie's celebrated novel."
fresh," Funnier than Ed Wood and costarring James' brother Dave Franco, it's the best buddy picture about bad filmmakers since Boogie Nights."
fresh," Ice Age: The Meltdown is fine, in much the same way the first one was fine -- not as inventive as Pixar, but not out scratching for jokes like Chicken Little."
fresh," The 3D IMAX visuals do impress, but the subtext - that if you behave well, the Martians will zap your mother's brain - is a little out of this world."
rotten," As the second half wears on, the proceedings become monotonous."
rotten, A big disappointment. All the pretty vistas in the world can't enliven this protracted futuro-slog.
fresh, The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence) could be the sickest B movie ever made. But that's why you may feel gripped by the horror of what you're seeing and the terror of what's coming.
rotten," The gimmick-machinery whirrs, but the human beings in it can't breath"
fresh, Bond is back with a bang!
fresh," If for some reason you're undecided or thinking of voting for a third party candidate or just don't feel like going out to vote for anyone, then you should at least try to catch Moore's new movie. "
rotten," A noble failure in the canon of America's best sibling film team, a movie that was there just a bit too long."
fresh," Whereas the original, directed by Joseph Sargent, was essentially a well-oiled B movie, the new incarnation, directed by Tony Scott, is bristling with high-tech gimcrackery and over-the-top camera flourishes."
fresh," Crispin Hellion Glover's planned trilogy of blatant weirdness continues with a second installment, It Is Fine! Everything Is Fine."
fresh," ...if you are tired of Transformers and superhero flicks and want something of more substance and feeling, then give ""Terri"" a try."
fresh," Oddly for such a suspenseful film, Stranger by the Lake is rather encouraging in its insistence on the different shapes that human connection can take."
fresh, Bruce Willis hasn't been given material this solid to work with in years.
rotten," Ultimately a stodgy, overblown and repetitive slog."
fresh, A deeply satisfying and entertaining film that will appeal just as much to guys as their ladies.
rotten," Turns out Transformers: Age of Extinction actually lives up to its title and chronicles not just the death of our bond with the Autobots, but the death of cinema, and that once-fearsome T. rex called American culture."
rotten," Released in the U.S. on December 25, Unbroken is a Jolie, Jolie Christmas."
fresh," After watching your [Anton's] tantrums, abuse and addiction in DIG! I went straight to the record store to buy your music. And that's something."
rotten," Plot-wise, Insurgent doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but that tracks back to Veronica Roth's books, which build an entire world around a fundamentally silly premise and just hope the reader won't notice."
fresh," The script, also from Mills, borders on braggadocio at times. Like Abbie, it's all a touch too smug, a hint too clever, a punch too superior. "
rotten, Que pasa? Rien d'importance.
rotten, The race for the worst film of 2015 is officially on.
fresh," An occasionally exhilarating retelling of a fascinating, little-known story. And how Mezzogiorno missed awards consideration is a mystery."
rotten, DREW Barrymore tends to bring out the best in Adam Sandler - so much so that their re-teaming almost saves Blended.
fresh," Leggy Zeta-Jones is so hot in the 'All That Jazz' number, she's flammable. And Zellweger defines delicious."
rotten, My cat has coughed up hairballs that make more sense than MIAMI VICE
fresh, An edgy premise and memorable cast make for a potent first impression.
rotten, You'd probably be just as entertained chasing your own tail.
fresh," If it comes anywhere near your town, go see it and thank the movie Gods that it even exists. There's no star rating high enough."
rotten, This is moviemaking on autopilot.
fresh," There was no theme, ultimately, but the music did help move the movie along..."
fresh, Despicable Me has enough visual novelty and high spirits to keep the kiddies diverted and just enough wit to placate the parents.
rotten," ""V/H/S"" probably sounded great in the pitch meeting, but it loses all luster through some shoddy execution."
fresh, Where the film works best is in evoking the brash blue collar Rhode Island backdrop that shaped Vinny Paz into the kind of man who refuses to let a spinal fracture end his career.
fresh," Despite its occasionally unfinished feel, Hoodwinked will probably keep everyone (adults and kids) entertained for its very brief running time."
rotten, Depressing and sickeningly violent.
rotten, Enter at your own peril. And also be warned that Collette issues one of the few complete performance misfires of her career with a very loud bang.
fresh," If you can meet it halfway, ""Happy Death Day"" works well as an entertaining genre twist on a classic comedy."
rotten," The best recent parody movie. Not because it's good, but because it's only unbelievably boring while the others were unbearably irritating. "
fresh," When you see J-M's works next to Da Vinci, Picasso and Grey's Anatomy, you can see their influence, but their ideas take on new tone, texture and style under Basquiat's brush."
rotten, A watered-down likeness that curiously turns disaster flick in its too-scary third act.
rotten," Over-written and under-realized, it's Allen in desultory word-processor mode, barely able to muster even his usual amount of resigned cynicism about this crazy ol' life."
rotten," A particularly unlikeable protagonist, the sky-high expectations that come with a Palme d'or and the distinct sensation of ""been there, seen that""..."
fresh," For a dialogue heavy picture this one is exhilarating, and without even realizing it I discovered when it was finished I'd gently moved all the way forward in my seat to the point I was leaning on the one directly in front of me."
rotten," As much as I can recognize the obvious effort and specific intent that went into the film, I am at a complete loss to comprehend what exactly it's trying to say to me."
fresh," The results stay with you, like memories of an unexpected and surprising vacation."
rotten, Alpha and Omega is one of those rarities in the modern era of Hollywood animation: bad.
fresh, The American Dream remains but a hair trigger away from the American Nightmare in director David Cronenberg's brilliant and jarring A History of Violence.
fresh, Pretty soon the commentary on how Hollywood uses women as decoration outweighs the fact that Mitchell's just repeating the cycle - albeit with better-than-average outfits.
fresh," At its conclusion not everything is entirely clear, but enough pieces fall into place to leave a feeling of satisfaction."
fresh," A little more polish in the writing could have made it a must-see, but as it stands, it's a fairly solid B-movie matinee with a nicely calibrated mix of intellectual dread and visceral shock."
fresh, A worthy follow-up even if there's less creativity involved once the central premise is introduced.
fresh," It is a dark, hypnotic, unsettling experience."
rotten, one of 2008's most crass commercial statements.
fresh," While the fantasy and whimsy captures the playful imagination of children, a powerful undercurrent of emotional crisis grounds their experience..."
rotten, The plot is inconsequential because in the end it all results in a hodge-podge of provocative images (some sickening) that add up to little more than a big WTF yawn.
rotten," It's about as magical as a frog that doesn't turn into a prince when you kiss it, but still gives you warts. "
rotten," [T]he central performances seem to exist in their own, isolated bubbles."
rotten," It's hard to hit that sweet spot, where a kid's film can feel like it has real moments of jeopardy to sate an adult audience without terrifying the younger viewers, and I'm not quite sure the film pulled it off."
fresh," It is often deliciously, horrifically awkward and downright uncomfortable. "
fresh, A haunting meditation on the nature of humanity and how to survive our own downfall.
fresh," A generally fun movie that offers a different perspective on, well, a different perspective."
rotten, The story is involving but the character are types rather than authentic individuals.
rotten," I was surprised by how closely it conforms, beat by beat, to the most ruthless Hollywood vigilante template. It's all about insults, emasculation."
rotten," Compass isn't well-made. The heroine is a pill, the issues are jumbled (maybe because of the attempt not to offend potential moviegoers) and the storytelling is clunky."
rotten, A bad sit-com of a movie.
fresh," It's a decent, well-acted drama, if a little blandly dull in its approach."
fresh," [Meryl] Streep shines. But then, she always does."
rotten," Someone already versed in Morrissey could sit there and check off the influences, but someone who goes in knowing nothing about the man will see only the surface, the occasional photo or song snippet."
fresh," Thanks to grounded performances from its top-notch cast, Lars overcomes an ultra-quirky premise and develops into a thoughtful, albeit unusual, romance."
fresh," The whole plot has about as much mystery as a performance on a pole, but it's the brief encounters with believable disaster that give the movie its winning character. Sure, it's hokey and pat, but Patti and Jheri are fantastic... "
rotten," An enjoyably silly piece of pulp fiction, but the writer's main influence is undoubtedly Donald Kaufman, if you know what I mean."
rotten," ScarJo breaks a lot of real and synthetic bones, but the movie doesn't break any new ground."
rotten," The half-jokey, half-serious dynamic that works so well in The Big Short - where laughs get caught in your throat - fails to find its groove here. "
fresh," There's a pleasant texture to the visuals of Southside With You, a soft visual style that compliments the two stellar leads."
rotten," Some of this is funny, thanks to the playful performances, but much of it just seems familiar and juvenile."
rotten," A meandering, unfocused kind-of love story among 20 and 30-somethings that grates as much as it pleases."
fresh," It suffers from an implausible and contrived plot, but the charming performances from the teenage leads greatly improve this film."
fresh," An invaluable experiment, that creates more questions than it answers... in a good way. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten, The problem is that it usually succumbs to the ungovernable forces of cloying melodrama and didacticism. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten, A film that flirts and flirts with explanations for its action without ever delivering.
rotten, Brandon's cunning plan to step out of his father's shadow is basically to plagiarise every movie he's ever made.
rotten," With its fantastic images, which prompt us to grin in unison and nod in knowing recognition, this documentary is as soothing and edifying as watching a video loop of the Yuletide log."
fresh," Morgen and his editors do more than just provide a potted history. The fast cuts, which remind me of Arthur Lipsett's avant-garde NFB work, give the feeling of the whirlwind popularity of the band's early years."
fresh," Though wonky, Mary Queen of Scots awed me. "
rotten," 'Beautiful Creatures' is stylish, campy fun at times."
rotten," ... neither witty nor insightful in its comic observations, instead relying on low-brow gags and stereotypes out of desperation."
rotten, This fictionalized tale of two Los Angeles detectives assigned to the gruesome 1940s murder of a real-life wannabe starlet begins as a slow but intriguing character study that gradually unravels into a turgid mess.
rotten, One of Eastwood's sloppier efforts.
rotten, You feel that at any moment Steve Reeves might come bellowing around the corner - and that's no bad thing.
fresh," Certainly this remake will not leave everyone smiling, but by taking a modern myth and turning it into a moral minefield, it earns its place in the annals of unease."
rotten, Wes Anderson remains trapped in the aquarium of his own imagination.
fresh, It's a reality that might best be encountered when you're in the right mood for it. 
fresh," It didn't quite make my top 10 list, but it is not bad."
fresh, Chadwick Boseman is absolutely electric as the centrepiece of Tate Taylor's James Brown biopic.
fresh, While its message is simple -- innocent young Americans are taught to be machine-like killers -- its technique is extraordinary.
fresh, Monitoring the peaks and troughs of this fractious relationship is more fascinating than enjoyable.
rotten, So why did the master of 21st-century transgressive French cinema make such a tame and sentimental film? I think it's because he had nowhere else to go after making three really great and extreme films. 
fresh, 12 Years a Slave is at times difficult to watch but always impossible to turn away from.
rotten," Almost redeemed by a thrilling final 15 minutes; at its best during watery action scenes while avoiding the trappings of a shallow, clichéd script."
fresh," The film's beauty, which is meant to suggest the dreams of the characters, is another crucial aspect of Sin Nombre's complexity."
rotten," Garth Jennings's Sing effectively acknowledges early on that it's following a completely unoriginal formula, and yet carries on regardless."
fresh," For some it's an anti-war message, for others it's just a non-biased portrait of a man who never went to war despite being in the military during war time."
rotten, A highlight reel of gunfire and explosions masquerading as a political thriller ...
fresh," Chuck takes a lot of punches, but it lands some good ones, too."
fresh," Do yourself a favor and see Thoroughbreds, especially if you like to see something new. Like the best candy in the world, the story is darkly sweet."
rotten," Gary Oldman, bless his heart, chews scenery faster than a wolf chomping on a villager, but even his fangs aren't sharp enough to puncture the layer of cheese Hardwicke coats atop her dreadful film."
fresh," Batman and Robin it ain't; it's hard to believe ""The Dark Knight"" and Joel Schumacher's infamous camp extravaganza even came from the same universe, let alone the same franchise."
fresh, These three musketeers swagger their sarcasm like rapiers wielded in the spirit of a collective self-preservation.
fresh, Charming film of a type completely absent these days.
fresh," For what he has said will be his final film, animation maestro Hayao Miyazaki tackles a controversial biopic that could just as easily have been shot in live action. "
rotten, Cast actors with a bit of box-office clout; hire a director smart enough to shoot each explosion so it can be shown multiple times from different angles; find a script with all the depth and complexities of a coloring book. And ``Action!''...
fresh," Its adult and hard-hitting subject matter probably won't bring in masala-loving family crowds, but it offers a lesson with long-lasting emotional and moral impact for thinking audiences."
rotten," O'Donnell and Zellweger are easy on the eyes, but we're asked to take it on faith that they have other qualities that would make a person care for them."
fresh," I may feel a little nostalgia for the film, but even if you take that out of the equation, ""Anastasia"" works quite beautifully as a fun and emotional adventure."
fresh," This is a fun, cool, wild ride. "
rotten," A self-indulgent and irritating film of someone bent on telling a tragedy in a different way, stripping it of melodramatic resources. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh," It's not enough to compel cynics like myself, but it will likely touch the heart of romantics everywhere."
fresh," Reilly does nice work playing his big lug's insecurity and struggle to let his friend go, but Silverman delivers a performance that's downright moving in its expression of yearning - on a couple of different levels, interpretation depending."
rotten," The unraveling isn't as smartly written as the setup. And because the characters beyond the parents and boys aren't as finely tuned, the film starts to lag."
fresh," The Meddler feels a tad schematic, and nothing about the ending is very surprising. But the witty script make the piece very entertaining."
fresh," The lead actors, Geoffrey Couët (as Theo) and François Nambot (Hugo), deliver performances of subtlety and range."
fresh," Under the Sun at once illuminates the fakery of North Korea's outward projection, while recognizing the very real mental effect on the people supposedly meant to benefit."
fresh," ...a movie built around dazzling dialogue, which makes it a rare and precious thing."
rotten," I guess my expectations may have been too high. I didn't want a silly KUNG FU PANDA 2, loaded with jokes. I was hoping it would be more like the first one. "
rotten, Never Goin' Back is a version of The Florida Project that wildly misses the mark
fresh," Although the film has much to learn in the ways of subtlety and restraint, Zoo has effectively turned the ghastly backdrop of World War II into a fitting setting for a heartwarming, family-friendly film. "
fresh," Once the rude shock of a profane Claus wears off, there's not really much to do except await the next outrageous remark."
rotten," Meri Pyaari Bindu is the kind of romcom that feeds leading questions to potential detractors. Such as, can anything new be said about a love story? Why is Bindu the way she is? And when will this end?"
rotten," Utterly implausible on every level, and ultimately rather insulting: a bit of glitter and lots of hugs are the sum total of its 'girl power.'"
fresh," [D]oesn't seem to promise much going in ... but its eerie premise lingers in your mind. It may not qualify as a true ghost story, but it's still pretty haunting."
fresh," The search to nail down exact return policies on modern relationships drives both the humour and the edgy parts of Maggie's Plan, which features faultless delivery of beautifully entangled dialogue from writer-director Rebecca Miller."
fresh," Intriguing, fascinating, murderous!"
rotten," As B-grade movies go, this is pretty much par for the course - the plot is an excuse to show choreographed mayhem and that is what director Miller has concentrated on."
fresh," Colossal takes some dark turns in its later acts, serving as a keen metaphor for alcoholism and domestic abuse."
rotten, Jason Bateman is under-utilized in this underpowered comedy.
rotten," There is the risk of a credibility gap when charismatic and successful stars play ultra- dysfunctional types. That's why Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig never quite convince as Milo and Maggie, twins on the cusp of middle age."
fresh," What an intelligent, emotionally grown-up film. More of this please."
fresh," You wouldn't think a movie about a schlubby, perpetually depressed file clerk could be such seductive entertainment."

fresh," The Cell is a thrilling, unique tour of the human mind."
rotten," [B]road, crude, unsubtle remake of the brilliant 2007 British film... [T]he tone is wrong, the pacing is wrong, and the emphasis is in all the wrong places..."
rotten," ... painfully predictable, full of super-sized implausibilities, and crowded with supporting characters that are underdeveloped and overplayed. "
rotten, The film - which is nowhere near as interesting as LaBeouf's performance - is hopelessly reductive about its subjects' psychology even as it mocks the press of 1980 for being reductive about its subjects' psychology.
fresh," Hey, our man Brooks never claimed to have good taste. Bless him."
fresh," In spite of the film's obvious differences from Bergman's earlier work, it nonetheless explores many of his favorite themes, particularly from the ""island"" films."
fresh," First-time director Noam Murro successfully creates a world you want to spend time in, even if it's a world marred by self-absorption and missed opportunities."
fresh, An uneven movie that nonetheless bristles with stinging wit and exerts a perverse fascination.
rotten," This long, slow, boring, talky film is a vindictive calumny, making up things out of whole cloth, not a paean to a great man who almost singlehandedly stood up and opposed Hitler when it looked like all was lost. It is shameful with no raison d'être."
rotten, All sensation and no feeling.
fresh, Morris has created a film so relevant to our current political climate that many will feel guilty just for watching it.
fresh," This approach has the capacity to make its subject appear a repellant and even pathetic figure, but for avoiding that fate we can largely thank Cox for a magisterial and empathetic performance that gets under the leader's skin. "
fresh," The Staircase engenders a good deal of sympathy for the accused and especially for his family, while leaving the question of his guilt wide open."
fresh," Se queda grabada en el alma, esa alma que debiera seguir con polvos mágicos en vez de sólo empolvándose con el paso del tiempo."
rotten, What does Coppola want us to think about these beautiful young idiots? What does she think? She's too cool or too wary or too close to her subject to engage.
rotten, The filmmakers spend so little time world-building beyond the Community itself that [the plot] plays as ridiculous as it sounds.
rotten," A predictable, plucky underdog story, it hits every note the sentimental genre demands, from gritty blue-collar background to feel-good empowerment message."
fresh," ""Barney's Version,"" a film adaptation of Richler's 1997 valedictory novel of the same name, is an oddity in today's movie marketplace, a throwback to films cele-brating the lives of grown men, warts and all..."
rotten, This is a low voltage drama where the facial hair prosthetics on John Travolta's face are far more entertaining than anything else in the movie.
rotten," This is really just a standard, R-rated rom-com in cinematic sheep's clothing that follows the usual trajectory of the genre. (Complete Content Review for Parents Also Available)"
fresh, Zips along at a laugh-a-minute pace and fully involves the viewer in Bridget's little slice of life.
fresh," A Moment of Innocence may be slow, but it's steady, moving as gently and inexorably toward its surprising conclusion as the snow that falls endlessly over its cold, damp, befuddled characters."
rotten," Cringe-inducing, uneven, juvenile, overlong and painfully unfunny. It's a witless blend of crudeness, rudeness and lewdness which sets a new low for American comedy. "
rotten," I'm sorry, but James Bond was never meant to incite giggles."
fresh," Taps into our deepest, darkest fears, and offers us a bloody, instant horror classic that's not for the faint of heart."
fresh, Soul Power is a window into a time when anything seemed possible.
rotten," All spectacle and little substance, a stop-gap title produced perhaps to keep the brand going while the producers search for a way to bring the series forward."
fresh," Even before the film closes in on Isao Kusuno, the 2nd lieutenant who previously owned the sword, we're embroiled in a gripping saga, guided by Aidan MacCarthy's calm, matter-of-fact narration; as capable as ever."
fresh," Escape Room is an entertainingly cheesy and surprisingly innovative B-movie, but suffers when it turns its attention to setting up future sequels."
fresh, Ken Kesey decided the camera was mightier than the pen. This enjoyable but surprisingly unenlightening documentary suggests otherwise.
fresh," It is properly, hilariously inspired, and if this film can be classified as silent comedy, which I think it can despite all the grunts and squeaks in place of dialogue, then it deserves to be ranked with the best of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton."
fresh, The storytelling is top notch. It's a carefully-crafted dance of nuance that balances a bit of everything.
rotten," The basic outline of the plot, built around a promised local concert by the Rolling Stones - well, if you don't know where that story is headed, you haven't seen as many movies as I think you have."
fresh," It has the potency of a sympathetically fabricated kind of realist fiction, a guided-reality effect that is completely absorbing."
fresh, Trainwreck is anything but.
rotten, A disappointingly unoriginal and one-note biography of a man and his life that were anything but.
fresh," A road movie without a map, Tammy fuses Melissa McCarthy's patented comedy with character commentary for a messy, ambitious, slapstick drama."
fresh," An operatic extravaganza of thrilling action and nearly non-stop mayhem ... exhilarating, deranged and exhausting in almost equal measures."
fresh, The Big Short has a snappy energy that turns one of the most maddening events in recent history into something in which all the greedy pieces suddenly make sense.
rotten, The drama arising from attempts by humourless prison officials to erase the paintings and identify the creative culprit before the arrival of an inspector increasingly strains credulity.
rotten, Zoolander 2 feels less like its own movie and more like a Valentine's Day gift to all of the fans who have kept the character popular for all these years.
rotten, No film that's 129 minutes long should be called The Express - how about The Sleeper To Oblivion?
rotten," Scott, who directed ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner,"" looks at the world through veils of smog. What with these pictorial pollutants, he loses sight of plot."

rotten, It's the finest 97-minute advertisement for Yoda underpants released this week.
rotten, De Palma loyalists are defending this movie; I assume it's just out of habit.
fresh," On any level, earthly or otherwise, the ingenious new animated Hercules is pretty divine."
rotten," Najafi ... transfers Escape From New York across the Atlantic, turning London into the terrorist safari park of Donald Trump's most fevered imaginings."
fresh, Not to say this is not a well-crafted movie with excellent performances. It is. It is also curiously one-sided and shallow like many movies about famous outlaws tend to be.
fresh," Far from an enjoyable watch, but it's clearly not meant to be. It's a bleak, brutal experience that's truly hard to view, given its true-life inspiration."
rotten, Acting is good by the talented cast ... but the sentimentality is cheap and unworkable.
fresh, The ultimate lesson of His Girl Friday--that it's tougher to manage a marriage than a newspaper--looks in 2008 like pure nostalgia.
fresh," Tight and lean and eminently watchable, like Zac Efron's torso."
rotten, The story is involving but the character are types rather than authentic individuals.
rotten," ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" is a creaky, sometimes painfully boring Old Testament slog, and finds the visionary director unable to successfully wrangle a human story out of a tale of gods and kings."
rotten," In all, though, Cop Out is not much cop."
rotten," It's perfectly suited for the limousine liberals who flock to Park City each year, looking to be engaged but not challenged in any big way."
rotten, So narratively old-fashioned it creaks.
rotten," The paeans about national pride and brotherhood may be regional, but constant slow-motion battle scenes and squishy sentimentality are strictly wanna-be Tinseltown."
rotten," As heroic failures go, it's up there with the best."
fresh," Grand Budapest is a culmination of the tinkly music-box aesthetic of Anderson's work to date, turned up to 11."
fresh, Don't go for the plot. Go for the dancing. It's electrifying.
fresh," Spider-Man 3 is better than most comic book-based superhero action epics, but not as satisfying as the first two installments of this multi-billion dollar franchise. I guess familiarity breeds disrespect."
rotten," ""Winter's Tale"" wants to be a magical romance that leaves you feeling like the universe is full of secret purpose, but instead it's convoluted, over-narrated and deeply silly."
fresh, De Niro is delightful and funny!
fresh," Landon's scary movie offers a short, sharp shock to the system. Let it make your day."
rotten," This film is so bloated, so tone deaf, so seemingly edited with a Cusinart, that you'll feel you've been scalped more than once by the time you view a wrinkled Tonto walking off into the horizon step by step as the unending credits steamroll over him."
fresh," John Curran eschews hollow moralizing, opting instead for Herzogian spectacle with discreet, if somewhat shallow, psychological underpinnings. "
fresh," The film is a powerhouse, a viscerally charged powder keg of passion, triumph, regret, valor and depression all fighting with one another tooth and nail for supremacy."
rotten," It's bigger, noisier, shinier, and dumber, and it has no earthly reason to exist."
rotten," a whole lot of set-up for what we imagine will be payoff in Part 2, which doesn't necessarily make it any easier to slog through"
fresh," Giamatti's face is a thing of pure comic beauty: staring off into the middle distance, frozen by the conflicting demands of etiquette and his stifled inner howl. He makes humiliation sing."
fresh," As retreads go, Django Unchained is as much a comedown from its predecessor as Lars von Trier's Manderlay was from Dogville."
fresh, It gets by on personality.
rotten," Interestingly, the more overblown and insincere a performance Pacino delivers in a film, the more self-important and bouffant his hair gets. Here, it's so towering it takes up 90 per cent of the screen."
fresh," Fascinating study of the ecology of invasive species and their impact on Louisiana wetlands as well as loving tribute to Cajun survival instincts, comparable ironically to those of the rodent."
rotten," A film can't just rely on the surefire ingredients a big-budget film needs to become a box-office success. This film did, and because ""Contraband"" played it too safe and didn't take risks, its surefire bet misfires."
rotten, There is a lot of half-baked soap opera wrapped around the hypnosis scenes.
rotten," Some class-conscious scenes are in poor taste. And ​yet​ again, we note with regret, there isn't one single young woman who is, you know, just nice and regular. And not dying to be bedded or wedded."
rotten," The people in ""The Best Man Holiday"" - not just the actors, but the characters they play - deserved a better script than this."
fresh, Una mirada digna y humanizada (si bien un poco idealista) al proceso revolucionario del Ché Guevara en Cuba. Lo mejor: la convincente labor protagónica de Benicio Del Toro.
fresh," En pleno 2012, entre el auge de las vistosas superproducciones en 3D y la sobresaturación de videos en YouTube, una película muda y en blanco y negro logra entretener y emocionar como lo hacían hace 90 años."
fresh," On a smaller, less-cosmic scale of appreciation, Pearl's uplifting story is a welcome reminder that any pursuit of growth and nurturing will yield unexpectedly wonderful dividends."
fresh, This fine and funny film proves that a love that nurtures fills an emptiness that nothing else can fill. 
fresh, An immensely enjoyable fable...
rotten," The bland, jittery visual ""realism"" can't counteract overheated performances of tin-eared dialogue, which strain for pulp but often land at soap."
fresh," Once you get past the thongs, the uniforms, and the sleek choreographed stripping dance routines -- admittedly, the main attraction of Magic Mike for most audiences -- it's just another day at the office for Steven Soderbergh"
fresh," A movie about childhood nightmares that plays too much like an actual, incoherent nightmare to make a good movie, Intruders is a psychodrama divided against itself."
rotten," [Swanberg] tries to be fair to all parties, which smothers the conflict with a warm blanket."
rotten, Poker is still waiting for its defining moment in the cinematic spotlight.
rotten," ""Wild"" stumbles when it becomes too focused on the destination, whether that's the Oregon trailhead or the Oscar night red carpet."
fresh," Don't plan on the perfect ending, but Sweet Home Alabama hits the mark with critics who escaped from a small town life."
fresh," What comes through in ""Hal"" is that the kind of movies Ashby excelled at making were a challenge to get made even then, and face more formidable hurdles -- ... character-driven films have taken a back seat to the pursuit of global hits."
fresh," The attention to detail is extraordinary, and the filmmaking techniques are all excellent, yet I find myself outside the picture looking in throughout the film, analysing it instead of believing it"
rotten, P.D. James's novel must have made more sense than Cuarón's cheerful but incoherent screen adaptation.
fresh," His performance may feel too Actors Studio at times, but he radiates his broad-spectrum intensity until Lenny becomes something of a Dustin Hoffman film festival in miniature."
fresh," Witty but not campy, grand without being unduly somber, it is a crazy, almost-coherent riot of intrigue, color and kineticism anchored by the charisma of its cast."
fresh," With Phantom Thread, Paul Thomas Anderson has crafted a delirious, lush, hypnotic, pitch-black comedy."
fresh," The Girl With All the Gifts finds a fresh, gutsy approach to the zombie virus apocalypse movie."
rotten," There's suspension of disbelief, and there's pureeing your brain 'Top Chef'-style."
fresh," It's light-years away from being an Eastwood classic, but it passes a likable two hours."
fresh," Contando (ou ""cantando"") com uma belíssima direção de arte, o filme traz Catherine Deneuve em uma sensível história de amor - que se torna ainda mais tocante graças ao fascinante tom operístico da produção."
rotten," ""The Overnight"" ends just as it starts to get interestingly messy ..."
rotten," I didn't think Diaz could be humiliated more than she was in ""Knight and Day,"" drugged and shipped as luggage, but I was wrong."
rotten," Sigh, and I had such high hopes."
fresh," The real star of the film is the technology [...] Password protected accounts are a short confirmation email away, and geo-tags reveal more history than an interrogation. "
rotten, The latest film to appeal to the worst in human nature is 10 Cloverfield Lane.
fresh," It stands out thanks to the graceful, thoughtful characterization of its three protagonists, despite their potential to be monstrous caricatures."
fresh," With superb performances from its stars, Villains is the black comedy thriller that is sure to stand out among the crowd."
rotten," All this pseudish cultural analysis robs the story of its emotion. It's not the lack of action, it's the lack of feeling that's the problem."

rotten, The film's bark is better than its bite.
fresh," These Fast and Furious movies are different, they've actually improved upon the mistakes of their predecessors."
fresh, ...it's a B-movie that manages to be more than a potboiler.
rotten, The movie is sincere and earnest but rendered in such a straightforward fashion that the stakes never seem especially high.
rotten," Nim isn't a great role model, her preposterously selfish father even less so, and any parent that urges their child to emulate her probably should have their head examined."
fresh, Guaranteed to thunder on the big screen.
rotten," Lots of things never become clear in ""G.I.,"" which is so busy setting up a sequel that it doesn't even tell us what has become of two of the three main bad guys."
fresh, A welcome return to form for Dayton and Faris
rotten," Though it sets out to explain why this marriage is worth saving, The Story of Us could prompt even single members of the audience to file for divorce."
rotten, Long and vanilla.
fresh," [A] sensitive, occasionally didactic film."
rotten, Confused and disjointed.
rotten," Why these two women are attracted to each other beyond looks is a mystery; eventually they swap backstories, but neither is compelling enough for one to invest in the character."
rotten," Features three of the most frightening noses in the business (Streisand, Hoffman and Owen Wilson). Consider yourself lucky it's not in 3D."
rotten, A confused and confusing compromise at best and a dull obfuscation of history at worst.
rotten," Chris Owens: You're onscreen for about half a minute of The Recruit, but that half a minute was the most enjoyable experience I had all evening."
fresh, Peanut butter and chocolate. Fish and chips. The heist movie and the submarine picture. These things go together so perfectly that it's a wonder they were ever apart.
fresh, A nice little creeper whose only limitations are its own efforts to be something more.
fresh," ""Charming and sweet, wrapping a leash around your heart."""
rotten," The Clapper hints at the psychological roots of Eddie's peculiar personality, but in the end it isn't at all interested in understanding the man. And that's because it's too busy making fun of him. "
rotten," A ponderous, deeply unironic psychological portrait with such a pervasive sense of gravitas that it borders on self-importance."
rotten, Rize isn't a revolution. It's a fashion shoot.
rotten," You're left with a lovingly rendered portrait of a cipher, a protagonist who never lets you in and therefore one in whom you can't invest too much emotion."
rotten, Just call it Hustle and Low.
fresh, Falling on the right side of the line that divides the warmth of everyday history from the easy comfort of nostalgia.
rotten," A silly horror movie at heart, Lucile Hadihalilovic's Innocence follow-up seems to confuse ""ideas"" with ""prolonged silences."""
rotten," Cotillard's performance is a match for the histrionics, but Rust and Bone still could cut a lot of fat."
fresh," If you undertake this movie, don't judge it as it goes along. That won't work. It's a film that demands to be seen its entirety before its impact can be felt. Sad, shattering, and unpleasant, it's too vital a work to be ignored."
rotten, Jolie does as well as she can with the twigs they've given her to make a plot house out of.
fresh, I'd argue it's emotionally richer and more surprising [than Pan's Labyrinth].
fresh," ""Tea with the Dames"" is hardly a groundbreaking documentary to watch. However, for fans of the craft of acting and of these legends, it's a can't miss."
rotten, It's too bad the film isn't funnier.
fresh," ...delightfully dark, like the occasionally welcome sound of laughter in a funeral home -- a sound kids often appreciate more than grown-ups."
fresh," It could have become, like so many other biopics, a narrative version of Davis' Wikipedia page. Instead, it becomes something striking and distinct -- and illuminating. "
fresh," Streep finally gets her chance to cut loose -- and her frisky, flirty Jane is a comic revelation."
fresh, Each of the six vignettes that make up this unusually energetic anthology pertains to the methods of calculated mass dehumanization that are (barely) hidden beneath the practices of social institutions.
rotten," Although the film zips along efficiently enough, Death Race is never as much fun as it seems to think it is."
fresh, A masterful tale - a tapestry of extraordinary color.
fresh," I found him a sympathetic, and strangely believable, middle-aged dad."
fresh," The beauty of Chasing Coral is matched only by its urgency, as director Jeff Orlowski encapsulates the issue of global climate change by showing where it's doing real, measurable damage in real time: The world's coral reefs."
rotten," The Light Between the Oceans is no masterpiece. It doesn't even make it to ""pretty good."" For a picture with the word ""Light"" in its title, this one is awfully murky."
rotten, The creative cognitive dissonance on display in Scream 4 is truly astonishing... Forget meta horror comedies: it's as if neither Craven nor Williamson have seen a single movie of any kind at all in the past decade.
fresh," Beautifully acted and shot, ""The Silent Child"" is my pick to win. "
rotten, The actors possess enough charisma and good spirit to charm even if there's the sneaking suspicion that their skills are in service of something mediocre.
rotten, As dull and arid as a hike through the desert.
rotten," Aside from Goggins and Vikander, who makes for a plucky underdog Lara and classes up the joint considerably, everyone involved seems to be just going through the motions."
rotten," There is some immature amusement to be had by ""21 & Over,"" the occasional clever line of dialogue or quirky situation, but then there's the majority of time spent wallowing in stereotypes, mixed messaging, and overbearing racial insensitivity."
rotten," If the two leading characters were women, this would have gone straight to the Lifetime network."
rotten," For all of Black's slovenly tics, his impish drive is the only thing that keeps Nacho Libre from slipping off the tracks."
rotten," What we're left with isn't an embarrassment, but isn't anything for this proud cast to glory in, either."
fresh," Right now with ticket prices sky rocketing, why not see a flick that will keep you cringing and practically feels like an amusement park ride."
rotten," Roos' stories eventually overlap in a tangle of pat fairy-tale endings, after which he treats his characters to the sort of wrap party given to the casts of a beloved TV series that has just finished its last episode."
rotten," Bridgend, with its dark-blue-hued cinematography and murky music, is all foreboding atmosphere. "
rotten," A story which makes little to no sense, with huge sub-plots (all involving black or Latino characters) either abandoned or stitched awkwardly together."
fresh, It would be no country for movie lovers without the Coens. They still manage to run unmuzzled while the rest of Hollywood runs scared.
fresh," Hereditary draws on the tropes of many different horror genres, which the fully engaged cast manage to help pull off without it all becoming too confusing."
rotten," Happy Death Day 2U finally collapses under the weight of its own ambitions, as well as some unfortunate forays into slapstick."
fresh, One of those rare sequels that's bigger and better than the first.
fresh," The film does take a few too many turns on its journey. The end feels rushed, outlandish and possibly even reshot"
fresh, A harrowing journey of two women made desperate by a government that puts bureaucracy ahead of the interests of its people.
fresh," With its austere atmosphere, glacial pace and longwinded plot, it's not a film for everyone."
fresh," The thoughtfully assembled story of a young, opinionated and infinitely talented immigrant woman."
rotten," Subterranean thriller buries plot, unlikable characters and tension."
fresh," There's much to enjoy here in a disposable way, particularly jokes about monsters having ordinary problems with kids and spouses."
rotten, There are real issues here that need to be explored -- the neurosis of fame and its consequent personal and relational stresses -- but Country Strong gives them only surface treatment.
fresh," The pace is languid, but doesn't get tiring. Take the plunge and watch this romantic comedy."
rotten, A lack of pretense shouldn't mean a lack of wit or excitement...
rotten," To paraphrase Groucho Marx, this is a movie where we watch Will Smith, Edward Norton, Kate Winslet, Helen Mirren, Naomie Harris, Keira Knightley and several other fine players bore holes in themselves so that we can watch the sap run out."
rotten," ""47 Meters Down"" - despite a clever final section - struggles to extract tension from clamor and agitation."
rotten," In 1988, Gary Hart's promising presidential candidacy fizzled out. Perhaps it's only fitting that his movie follows suit."
fresh," The barbaric practice of hazing... turns out to be a toxic brew of sadomasochism and machismo, which makes this unflinching American indie drama at times tough to watch."
fresh," Fuelled by scintillating performances and a stellar soundtrack, A Star Is Born is a magnificent achievement that will capture the hearts of almost everyone that it touches."
rotten, The plot eventually devolves into a mystery so blindingly obvious most will have it figured out before it even starts.
fresh," A merciless, demoniac satire in the future imperfect."
fresh," Interesting and worth watching, despite the fact that complete comprehension of the film seems just beyond the reach of the viewer."
fresh, The film's moments of clunkiness are worth overlooking given its strength when Fish Tank stops trying to deliver a message and instead listens to its characters.
fresh," [Cold Fever is] an undiluted pleasure, a road movie combining often surreal comedy and a wealth of gorgeous visuals, capturing Iceland at its most hauntingly ethereal."
rotten," It's the cinematic equivalent to a carnival funhouse: a bit scary when you're traversing it, but utterly forgettable (and mildly regrettable) once it's over."
fresh," At its core, The Lego Movie is an ode to imagination, creativity and busting outside the status quo, so it's wholly fitting that the film itself - from its storytelling through to its superb animation - embodies these qualities beautifully."
rotten, The serious nature of the movie indicates the filmmakers weren't out to spoof anything but it may have been better if they had.
rotten, Bill Murray is reduced to nothing more than a walking gross-out joke.
rotten, Even kids may get testy watching what amounts to 90 minutes of product placement.
rotten," Even with sympathy for Halle Berry, Kidnap is still an atrocity, in contention for worst movie of 2017. "
fresh," Even though its historical references and battle scenes may fly over their heads like so many homing pigeons, kids will enjoy Valiant, too, if only for its nonstop action and lively visual design."
rotten," Spirituality can be a beautiful thing to explore in cinema, but ""War Room"" has no interest in engaging its audience on a personal level."
fresh," Moments like these speak to people's basic humanity and, combined with the Rainey clan's refusal to suffer defeat, give us reason to be optimistic."
fresh," What links all these characters is Myers's gift for antic, elfin burlesque. He's like a second-best Peter Sellers."
rotten," The Devil and Father Amorth feels at once bloated and slight, like a DVD supplement puffed up to feature length."
rotten, King Arthur offers a revisionist portrait of the legendary leader and warrior that expends almost all its energy on one bloody battle sequence after another.
rotten," If you've ever gazed at Christmas cards featuring artworks of the great masters and wished those images would magically come to life, [this] is your kind of movie."
rotten," I half-believed this movie was, indeed, a video game that Paul W.S. Anderson was playing in his underwear while smoking a bong."
fresh, ... intoxicating movie. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh," It begs you to forgive any flaws ... for the sake of its important message. Under all its flashy visuals, it reminds us that life isn't a fairy tale."
fresh," A slow and mesmerizing drama about the interactions of dreams and sleeping, healing and visitations by other-worldly beings in our everyday world."
rotten," This Is It doesn't have enough revelatory, caught-on-the-fly footage of Jackson to raise it above the level of a well-produced DVD extra."
rotten," Allows Wesley Snipes to show off his athletic prowess, but the storytelling leaves quite a bit to be desired."
fresh, It needs to be on your list of do-not-miss films.
fresh," [A] sharp, frightening 7-minute documentary."
rotten," Unsurprisingly for a film detailing terminal disease, this is a largely solemn affair, often verging on morbidity in its elongated death watch."
rotten, So bad that you might expect it's intended as a campy send-up of its source...the worst-case scenario is that it's a truly faithful reflection of the quality of the novel.
fresh, A claustrophobic thriller full of action. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh," It's a spirited, eloquent film-delightfully offbeat, deliciously different and well worth investigating."
fresh, A cinematic Columbine filled with wanton carnage designed to validate the bloodlust of every ostracized loser stuck in a dead-end job and daydreaming of evening the score by going postal.
fresh," Watch this if you are in the mood for a creepy film whose intention is to startle you, but not designed for gross shock value."
fresh," Delivers romance, passion, heartbreak and surprises - beautifully. The film is an ideal chick flick, date movie and emotional tour de force for anyone who is a romantic at heart"
rotten," It's a film of disappointing anonymity, a half-baked TV movie masquerading as Oscarbait, a curious misstep for the Oscar-nominated indie auteur."
rotten," I was curious to see why we needed a two-hour documentary about the three-hit wonder who cast away his career halfway through life and coasted on celebrity status for 30 years. After seeing Gonzo, I'm still not convinced we do."
rotten," Offers giant rocks clearly made of Styrofoam and Dwayne Johnson, who fits the same description."
rotten, Perhaps Hittman relies too much on that aura to give her sophomore film a coherence it doesn't quite earn.
fresh," There's humor in all this misfortune. But the more you watch, the more you empathize."
fresh," In spite of its many faults, The Strangers: Prey At Night is entertaining. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten, ...doesn't so much try to send up other spy films as it tries to one-up its own predecessor in this second go-round.
fresh," ""Vol. 2"" might have been a bit more focused. Still, it's an imaginative romp that once again reflects Gunn's unique and irreverent sensibility."
rotten, The storytelling in The Snowman is the cinematic equivalent of listening to somebody trying to remember the plot of a paperback they read in an airport 10 years ago.
rotten," Nothing is exultant, dramatic, epic, heroic, complex or just entertaining to me. The film is overwhelmingly empty, and lacks minimal grace and rhythm. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten, At no point does this dual-timeline setup ever feel like one unified project -- the aesthetics of mid-70's era America and the Vague Future Apocalypse are so wildly disparate as to feel like totally different movies.
rotten, Ghost gets a romantic-comedy redo with this strained love-triangle tale.
fresh," By weaving in old speeches, pieces from other books, and even some visual juxtapositions that maybe only he fully understands, the director makes a persuasive, intuitive case for Baldwin as a poet and a prophet."
rotten," There's almost nothing you can take away from this experience except an onslaught of unpleasantness. Which is too bad, because Phillips shows a lot of promise behind the camera."
rotten, The only thing Hitman succeeds in doing is confirming what common sense could tell you without spending millions of dollars on a special-effects-filled movie: A series of novels is much richer source material than a series of video games.
rotten," The movie, as a whole, doesn't hang together."
fresh," A delightful French film about a writer, his many female friends and lovers, his adventures in Manhattan, and his yen for being a good father. "
fresh," Shmuel's trancelike idiocy is broad for my taste, but Röhrig's helplessness is affecting and has a larger resonance."
rotten, The kind of movie that one watches to clear the mind after a hectic day. [full review in Spanish]
fresh," The Stranger is far from a perfect film, but it's admirably eerie and remarkably restrained."
rotten, Much of this is funny and even perceptive about the nooks and crannies of adult sexual relationships. It's also very well acted ... But something feels off.
fresh, Two fine lead performances help to raise Holofcener's somewhat middling rom-com.
fresh," Strip it down to its barest form, and what you have is a been-there-done-that sports movie with a speech standing in for 'the big game'."
rotten," Fleshing out one of Disney's quintessential villains is an intriguing idea. But, while ""Maleficent"" teases at the premise's potential, it never quite sustains the magic."
fresh, A witty family comedy that has enough sly humour to keep adults chuckling throughout.
fresh," A confident, rough, and confrontational horror film."
rotten," Watching this movie is like spending two hours and 27 minutes staring at a gigantic aquarium full of digital sea creatures and actors on wires, pretending to swim."
fresh, Meryl Streep continues her run of screw-the-Oscars movies with this ridiculously watchable comedy.
fresh, ... a movie about overt passion -- passion that is genuine and deserved as well as passion that is a kind of mask.
rotten," Think Blair Witch meets Godzilla, and since that isn't the first or last time you'll read that comparison, think of a movie that results in something less profound."
rotten, Number of record-scratch jokes? Three. Number of walk-into-a-lamppost gags? Two. Number of laughs? Take a wild guess.
rotten," Burton really needed to lean his horror-comedy more toward horror. Instead, it's reminiscent at times of Love at First Bite and the feature film remakes of The Addams Family and The Brady Bunch."
fresh," Jiro dreams of airplanes in this biographical drama about an aircraft designer who sees his love of aircraft and his love of his wife turn to ashes during World War II. Even after these tragedies, his dreams live on."

fresh," Ledger exudes an impetuousness that's in keeping with Lords of Dogtown's infectious, devil-may-care swagger"
rotten, The most excruciating 86 minutes one might sit through this summer that do not involve a dentist drill.
rotten," At best, Snow White and the Huntsman is pretty but forgettable. At worst, as with its occasionally anachronistic dialogue ('passed away,' 'OK') and its heroine's sadly undeveloped character, there's something rather hollow about these dark woods."
rotten," It's an elegantly shot and designed tale, yet strangely lacking in emotional weight."
rotten," Lewis' allegorical lectures on living rightly are here, but their weight is missing."
fresh," You'll be fascinated, frustrated and enraged by ""The Ambassador,"" which is something like a bastard reworking of Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" staged by Don DeLillo and Sacha Baron Cohen."
fresh," White House Down is amply endowed with enough tension, humor, and calamitous action to ensure it a solid berth in the summer box-office sweepstakes."
rotten," With the exception of some striking images by cinematographer Marcos B. Bohórquez, it gets stuck in the trudging, monotonous bitterness of three main characters, who never step out into the bright Caribbean light."
fresh, Witty direction and an exceptionally sharp script give this coming-of-age film a blast of originality that completely wins us over.
fresh, Even those who are too young to remember Zappa's work may be drawn in by his iconic rebel status.
fresh," Thankfully, Taylor and his cast create enough laughs and just enough thrilling set pieces to save the project from being crushed under the weight of its own dreary backstory."
rotten," Rock acquits himself nicely as the responsible brother and resident straight man, but everyone else in the cast has apparently been advised to mug shamelessly and yell their lines as loudly as possible, especially Tracy Morgan..."
rotten, Even star power can get lost in space.
rotten," It's getting so bad, you have to wonder if Adam Sandler doesn't sit in his gazillion dollar mansion, flipping through scripts, looking for the worst possible piece of crap he can find."
fresh," Iron Man 2 could have been just another action sequel if it weren't for Robert Downey Jnr delivering the complexity and self contradictory nature of Tony Stark, a man who is aware of his flaws but is not weighed down by them"
fresh, No film made could measure up to the avalanche of buzz and craziness surrounding this release. There is plenty of both good and bad news here.
fresh, It's a hoot and a half.
fresh, Plummer himself is perfect for this role. There aren't too many others who could convincingly play a demented nonagenarian with such verve. 
fresh, Practically guaranteed to sell more soundtracks than it does box office tickets.
rotten, The film's brazen sexism is matched by the shameless unoriginality of the conspiracy theories and clues that take up most of its runtime.
rotten," How desperate is Columbus if his creepy spiders look, act, and sound just like the Eight Legged Freaks"
fresh," As a scalding film experience about modern womanhood and its discontents, it has no peer this year."
fresh," ...very sexually explicit, grotesquely violent and visceral, and extreme..."
rotten, The slapstick sidekicks were tasty in small portions but they don't make much of a main course.
fresh," The picture has a romantic glow that recalls the Woody Allen of old and, of course, it's quite funny."
rotten," Ordinarily I'd be into the idea of seeing Nicolas Cage's face burn, but alas, ""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance"" is not a documentary."
fresh," Rather than simply celebrate queer highlife, this abstract view (coordinating the blue sky, sea, tanned bodies and aerial perspectives) dares us to reflect and intellectualize."
fresh," Ignore the critics on this movie. Yeah, I am one. Which means I'm telling you to ignore me, too."
fresh, Step-setter of its time.
fresh," ""Captain Marvel"" ultimately feels more obligatory than inspired, a movie that basically gets the job done and little more."
rotten," The film too often seems to be talking down, to its subjects and to its audience."
fresh," As gorgeous a film as Disney's ever put out, with astonishing qualities of light, movement, surface and color at the service of the best professional imaginations money can buy."
rotten, An extended game of 16th-century Barbie.
fresh," Finding Neverland is sentimental, to be sure, but a wonderful find for the patient viewer."
rotten," This repetitive round of mind-numbing, stupidly-elaborate traps will have you pleading for your soul to be saved by Tinkerbell, not Tobin Bell."
fresh," Ash Is Purest White, recommended for committed [director Jia Zhangke] admirers only, is a cold tonic to be taken in sips."
fresh, What good is immortality as a math megamind if you can't snuggle with your one-eyed cat--or frolic on the playground--with your friends today?
rotten," By the time Echo appears (in what basically amounts to a bit role - he's barely in the film), our incentive to care has been sundered."
rotten," If there's a facet of The Front Runner that justifies the film's seemingly purpose-void hand-wringing about protecting liberal icons, it's the central performance by Jackman."
rotten," Anna Faris can be cute and funny in the bubbly, ditzy, Goldie Hawn manner - as she proved in The House Bunny - but she's mostly shrill and irritating in lame chick flick What's Your Number"
fresh, A Tex-Mex-flavored shaggy-dog story that finds Duvall perfectly cast as a robustly cantankerous South Texas rancher determined to have one last fling south of the border.
fresh," A totally sustained immersion in the magisterially bleak, voluptuously monochromatic, undeniably beautiful universe of muddy villages and cell-like rooms."
rotten," I like the concept... Neat-o, if entirely outlandish... The problem is, screenwriters Brit Marling and Mike Cahill -- she also stars; he also directs -- don't know where to take it beyond that initial premise. "
fresh, Vera Brittain's celebrated memoir of the British home front in World War I gets a polished Masterpiece Theatre treatment that fails to diminish the story's wrenching emotional content.
rotten," The China Hustle is one of the most disingenuous, cynical, and ultimately ugly documentaries I've ever seen."
rotten," Funniest moment: Demi Moore rips open her top with a snarl, revealing the decidedly unattractive and wholly unnatural results of her cosmetic surgery."
fresh," Memorable images, conversations and a Willem Dafoe performace as artful as the master he portrays highlight one more special film on the life and times of Vincent Van Gogh."
fresh, ...the best thing about the film are the performances (especially Redmayne's) and James Marsh's elegant directing... [Full review in Spanish]
fresh, De Palma has the perfect recipe for a madcap rollercoaster ride that never allows the viewer time to sit still and take stock.
fresh, This is a terrific drama that highlights what has changed over the past 60 years and what has remained the same.
rotten," The thing is just a clunky and tasteless and dumb scare picture, isn't it? Clunky, yes. Tasteless, for sure. But not so dumb I fear."
rotten," Passengers delivers plenty of fairground ride-like spectacle. This, though, doesn't begin to atone for its evasive and equivocal storyline or for the mood of phoney optimism that always prevails, even at the very grimmest moments."
rotten, The Tale of Despereaux looks like an illuminated manuscript brought to life. Too bad the story's such a mess.
fresh," It's an exciting chase thriller, but it's thin, playing like the first act of three parts and while Cross is physically strong, he may not have the legs for it."
fresh," The film suggests they are still just starting to figure out what to do with this character, and I sincerely hope that the final credit of the film, 'Tony Stark Will Return,' is not just an empty promise."
fresh," The Imitation Game is a gripping and satisfying film which occupies dual genres, featuring a stunning performance from Cumberbatch. Another one to watch on Oscar night, for sure."
rotten," [With] dialogue as half-assed as its entry-level CGI effects, Elektra lacks thrills, narrative, emotion, believability, character development-and frankly-watchability."
fresh," A lot of energetic, laugh-out-loud fun, with enough there to keep the adults in the room entertained."
fresh," If The Journals of Musan indicates anything, it's that people, for the most part, either can't or simply aren't willing to comprehend the circumstances behind others' actions. "
fresh," Dan in Real Life is a film willing to admit that love is messy and that family, no matter how strained, is still the most perfect cauldron within which to ferment all those things that make life worth living..."
fresh," Burton's movie is not only more faithful, complex and better cast, it has an essential ingredient: squirrels."
fresh," The assured, at times bombastic direction, as well as the passionate performances, help distract from the more implausible aspects of the plot."
rotten, 'The Prestige' is one of those weird movies that plays better in memory than it does on the screen.
fresh," It's like being in a labyrinth, you never know what's going to be around the next corner."
fresh, American Gangster dares to look in the menacing mirror and reflect the scabrous priorities that define some handsomely yet disillusion others hauntingly.
fresh," It's a mood piece, and that mood is melancholy."
rotten," The filmmaking is aesthetically sublime, but that's about all it's got going, and by its climax, you're just waiting for them to check the double-murder boxes."
rotten," This isn't nitpicking. Every bit of the tale is as full of holes as a wool sweater at a moth convention, and Shyamalan telegraphs each potential surprise."
fresh, A great theme and visual compendium. [full review in Spanish]
fresh, Shrek 2 actually tells a creative story and doesn't just make fun of the fairytale genre but subverts it in some clever ways.
fresh," The Disaster Artist is a love letter to movies and the people who dream big enough to make them, even when they have no clue what they're doing."
rotten," The plot is full of italicised twists and kooky set-pieces, but grossly over-plotted and overwritten."
rotten," ... bar a few set-piece action scenes, this is mostly illogical, second-rate muck."
fresh," It's tremendous fun, even when it could be a little better."
rotten, More loud than funny...Maybe a few years down the line Griffin can give it another shot.
fresh," There's not much between this and a Sunday-night drama, but the ice-bound setting is different and beautiful."
fresh," It's art, not fun, be warned. Actually, it has to be said the portrait it so fondly gives of life in Leeds is repellent: drunken, abusive, indolent, violent, and just ugly in every possible respect."
fresh," Miraculously shot on an iPhone, but that is not really what makes this outrageous, outrageously good and original sex comedy/buddy film a small classic."
rotten, A wheezy and utterly incompetent attempt to further extend the life of a franchise that was already running on fumes back when Ronald Reagan was still a first-term president. 
fresh, The proposition that fashion is art is the subject of this fabulous documentary
rotten," Unrequited love does not exist. In fact, there's so much requiting going on, we start wishing to see someone get dumped just to add a little excitement to the mix."
fresh," An amazing true tale is somewhat diminished by second-hand storytelling: entirely admirable, largely entertaining, and yet curiously hollow."
fresh," The movie knows and loves gaming culture, but never uses that as an excuse to let the narrative slip."
rotten, What must have seem high-minded on the page ends up flat and rather silly on the screen despite committed performances and writer/director Knight's commendable ambitions.
fresh," Do I think adventurous moviegoers will get swept up in the way the characters -- and the movie -- abandon themselves to lives that are fully lived? Yes, I say. Yes, they will. Yes."
fresh," This nasty, perverted, and highly enjoyable erotic thriller is the most ferocious movie about matters of the heart since Dangerous Liaisons."
fresh," Paterson is a likable but very minor film about what is, for some, a major subject."
rotten," Becoming Jane becomes a rather ordinary, though sporadically entertaining, game of dress-up."
fresh," What Sandler does pull off here is an uncommon feat: a sequel that's an improvement over the original, which itself was a solid movie. Your kids will love ""Hotel Transylvania 2"" and you'll like it, too."
rotten, Quentin Tarantino no longer makes movies; he makes trailers.
rotten," ...a misguided vanity piece for the twin teenyboppers. Shockingly, this is one pronounced slab of pre-adolescent pabulum at its finest...or at its worst-simply take your pick"
fresh," Despite its schoolroom tone, The Vanishing of the Bees sounds an alarm; it's essential we heed it."
rotten," The bright spots (Momoa, that octopus) can be difficult to really relish amid the oceans of exposition and a typically pulverizing, overelaborate screenplay."
fresh," Cliched, yes, but ultimately succeeds thanks to a very specific sense of place and a star that's uniquely talented"
rotten, This mirthless Eddie Murphy vehicle from the director of 'Driving Miss Daisy' is rife with hoary 'magical negro' stereotypes.
rotten," People start wandering about in a zomboid fashion but no one notices. The acting deteriorates into overwrought melodramatics. The plot gets sillier and sillier, and makes less and less sense. The Box should be taken away in one, and speedily buried."
fresh, Bad Education lacks the ample comic breathers (Pedro) Almodóvar often brings to lessen his dramatic blow. Perhaps this one hits too close to home to laugh off. 
rotten, This is just disappointingly average.
fresh," The children just want to come out and play, and so do the very clever filmmakers running The Orphanage, a fastidiously grim ghost story that rattles the bones of the haunted-house genre and finds plenty of fresh (but not too bloody) meat."
fresh, The abundance of clips here are deftly chosen and play remarkably well out of context.
fresh," Tangerine will go on to be a gonzo, offbeat Christmas story for Grinchy people who are sick of watching the usual sentimental yuletide sap during the holidays."
rotten," The over-the-top performances would usually be suitable for this style of musical romp but the story, songs and dance numbers are not strong enough to sustain such hammy performances."
fresh," Man, I can't wait to see this one again on a lazy weekend."
rotten," The movie never quite shakes its stiff, studied feel, just as the town of Whistle Stop never stops seeming the quaint creation of an art director."
fresh, The marionettes run interference with our Hollywood-formula comfort zones -- forcing a fresh look at the hateful stupidity we take for granted every weekend at the multiplex.
fresh," beautifully shot fairytale gothic... allegorises the corrupting rapacity of colonialism in Imperial India, & looks forward to an independent India who may - or may not - be able to free herself once & for all from the hidden complicities of history."
rotten, The fights are effectively filmed and there are a few viscerally satisfying scenes but the production as a whole feels inconsequential.
rotten," The pacing of the film is painfully slow that by the time one gets to the payoff at the end and understands what's going on, you may be fighting to remember what happened during the film if you stayed awake for it."
rotten, A lifeless and sophomoric attempt at romantic comedy that draws on the fantasy films of old Hollywood but fails miserably.
rotten, All the capable techniques in the world can't gussy up the empty morality at its core.
rotten," The character design is ugly, and the story is tired, with corny song cues and easy stereotypes."
rotten, Sandra Bullock still has that winning smile but little else. Someone should give this misguided star/producer some sound career advice.
fresh," Ender's Game, for all its glossy special effects and laudable wartime moral questioning, lacks a fundamental sense of thrills."
fresh," Ross and crew succeed in converting Collins' best-selling text to the screen, and fans should reward their efforts. When it comes to The Hunger Games, the odds are ever in this film's favor. "
fresh," Fullmetal Alchemist has some good things going for it, but needs to fix the leaks and sputtering in the narrative's engine. The movie leaves room for a sequel, so maybe we'll get to see a new and improved Hagaren soon."
rotten," It is beautifully shot, as if through a filter. There is minimal dialogue and Lowery plays with the ghost and haunted house tropes. It lit only fires of irritation for me and the stars' dowdy low-key love felt hardly worth a haunting."
fresh," For at least part of its length, ""My Brother the Devil"" brings refreshing changes to a genre badly in need of them."
fresh," Everyone has a lesson to learn or an obstacle to overcome, but Jennings keeps the tone high-spirited rather than snarky or preachy."
rotten," There's no fire, and where their lines should ricochet with wit, they just spill forth, affably."
fresh," Mildred Pierce (1945) is a classic flashback film noir mixed with typical soap-operish elements of the woman's picture or ""weeper,"" and with"
rotten," The vanished child one really misses here is that adorably sparky, wised-up kid from Bugsy Malone and Alice Doesn't Live Here Any More."
rotten, the concept seems unfocused and the subject matter feels as if it is being handled with kid gloves
fresh," Sully won't just please crowds and evoke tears but, in an angry, ugly time in our national history, it should also resonate deeply with many."
rotten, Breasts heave and the sea storms as historical music swells in Shekhar Kapur's overwrought follow-up to Elizabeth.
fresh, This brilliant film explores what writer and director Adam McKay was able to uncover about Cheney's life through drama and considerable satire.
fresh, first major feature to surface in Africa
fresh," Talky, exploitive (for 1968) drama focusing on lesbianism."
fresh, Donnybrook is a powerful film that throws punches and pulls none.
fresh," Like a less oppressively hip Juno, Bandslam captures the way young people too smart and pop-culture-savvy for their own good let the music and movies they love define them during adolescence's crucible of humiliation and self-doubt."
rotten, I was shocked to learn this is an original screenplay and not an adaptation. Everything about the story stinks of a crappy novel someone bought at an airport.
fresh, [Reboux's] heartbreaking performance makes the movie quite watchable in spite of its obvious flaws.
fresh," Each time the movie seems to be on a head-on collision with melodrama, it jumps the track and veers off toward comedy."
fresh," Pacino's Will Dormer, taciturn and tormented Los Angeles cop, is his best performance in years."
fresh," It ably delivers scenes the sort of which the series' most ardent fans wish to see, [but] for those who aren't hardcore Tolkien enthusiasts it can be a bit of a slog."
rotten, The un-ironic title is like a spray-painted graffiti sign warning everyone to stay away from this sewage-swilling clogged cesspit masquerading as a movie.
rotten," When you lose respect for a film within the first five minutes, the rest is delirious history. I'm recording all this for posterity, so that I can read it out at the reunion in 20 years - as a survivor. A hero of my own accord."
rotten," It's certainly all Araki up there, and the film is handsome and swiftly paced. But it also feels terribly routine and even, strangely, for all the trangressiveness it strives for, retrograde."
fresh," For the satirically inclined, many chuckles are found in the run-up to the survivors' late-in-the-film, unfunny desperation. "
rotten," It gives this evil man the spotlight and platform he so clearly craves. And as much as Greengrass is aware of this conundrum, he never quite figures out a solution."
fresh," One of the film's greatest strengths is its complex depictions of male relationships - among them: father to son, son to father, brother to brother, lover to young man, and young man to lover."
fresh," A fascinating, warts-and-all documentary about one of the most notorious and influential figures in 20th Century politics."
fresh, It is quite unlike any other meditation on paranoia and displacement I have seen. It is perfect for kids.
fresh, The Savages is funny in the if-you-didn't-laugh-you'd-cry way and superbly acted by all involved
rotten," Aside from a few effective, low-key scenes, the movie doesn't involve the viewer."
fresh," The gags are telegraphed to such a ridiculous degree that you can see some of them coming literally an hour away. Yet when the punchlines arrive, Atkinson sells them with aplomb."
fresh, What's most remarkable is that screenwriter Tony Gilroy (co-writer of the original) - again cribbing (very) loosely from Ludlum's bestseller of the same name - is able to make so many standard spy film cliches fresh and exciting.
rotten," It's quirky, it's campy, and it's meant to be a dark comedy, but unfortunately, funny scenes like the ones that occur early on in this film are nowhere to be found later."
rotten," The film's darker elements are brushed aside and we're left with a zany, feel-good finale."
rotten, As powerful as a time-machine made Blue Peter-style out of cardboard and empty bottles.
fresh," He was a troublemaker, and a visionary. Sometimes Frank Zappa's sneer made me angry. But his challenges made me better. He made a lot of us better."
fresh," They had no interest in making an ""objective documentary,"" although I doubt the Hasidim would have made themselves available to two women with a camera and their own hair."
fresh," [A] tender, humane, gently probing film ..."
rotten, Nina teaches us an important lesson about waiting for a film to come out before criticizing it. For it is only then that we can know how truly heinous it is.
fresh, The film's good-natured rebellion and genuine enthusiasm for the power of rock 'n' roll can be infectious and enjoyable.
fresh," While its pace meanders, Stranger by the Lake proves to be an engrossing and darkly humorous watch."
rotten, Wouldn't it be great if mental illness really was as adorable as it is in the movies?
fresh, Deserves praise for penetrating this close-knit religious community and revealing the private suffering of some of its most conflicted believers.
rotten," Frankly, the guy just isn't very interesting."
fresh," [A]miable fun, with jokes geared to all age groups."
rotten, The acknowledgment that it is aiming solely for the kiddie audience this time around at least makes it slightly more palatable than its predecessors.
rotten," The deepening ties between Anna and Adrien have the same kind of dull, matte gloss of the black-and-white cinematography - monochrome that occasionally segues to color, an ill-conceived gambit occasioned by flashbacks and fleeting moments of joy."
fresh," I am thrilled beyond measure to be witness to the cinematic birth of a new, young voice in articulate, emotionally rich, cinematically rigorous horror cinema ... a mesmerising, totally compelling - and, yes, grisley - thrill ride."
rotten," Victoria & Abdul may capture the ugly side of Britain's colonial past, but its demeaning portrait of Abdul reinforces the Orientalism it purports to lampoon. "
rotten, How else to explain a wedding gown designed by Carolina Herrera in a town where the average gown is designed by Cooter and Otis Herrera.
rotten, You know what would be revolutionary? Making a really good movie about a three-dimensional teenage female character that doesn't start and finish with both eyes on the same old punishing character types.
fresh," Director Phillips may have set out to update the classic TV show, but what he ended up with is a 21st-Century remake of 'Dragnet', the Tom Hanks-Dan Aykroyd two-star flick. "
fresh," The latest feature from Pixar Animation is another splendid, eye-filling installment in the studio's unbroken string of classics."
rotten, The pace in Disobedience feels leaden and stale compared to Lelio's previous work. 
fresh," ""Buck"" is an absolute must-see for horse-lovers out there, but there also is plenty to enjoy for the non-equine-adorers as well."
fresh, the result is a meowvie with less ow to it than its predecessor.
rotten," What an ugly, droning nothing of a movie director Scott Cooper's Black Mass turns out to be. "
rotten, Even a blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while.
rotten," I believe all involved really mean it, but it's a long 80 minutes so I really hope it helped them work through whatever they needed it to."
fresh, A wonderful film that uses unexplainable phenomena as a backdrop for childhood innocence and discovery.
rotten," Like most of Neil LaBute's work in the field of ""emotional terrorism,"" the film protests that bad behavior isn't only good, but also essential to art."
fresh," Shamelessly pun-filled, sexually explicit, socio-political animation - for an adult audience."
rotten," Despite strong performances and plenty of incident, writer and director Biyi Bandele fails to establish the narrative's wider national and political context, and the film is ultimately insubstantial as a result."
fresh, The Debt roots itself in reality more plausibly than most contemporary spy films without sacrificing the genre's tense thrills.
rotten," Cage supplies a stream of tension-defusing laughs while the script steadily applies the screws, but this disposable exercise in comic nihilism offers only a modest payoff at best."
fresh," Even as Crossing the Bridge acknowledges differences, tensions, the provocative power music exerts on our hearts, it makes an elegant, head-bopping, hip-swaying argument that sound unifies."
rotten," It is two people in a bar, three or four beers in, just telling jokes to each other that are not even funny."
fresh," If you're fishing for fun in an ocean of movie mediocrity, grab the kids or the grandkids, fork out a few extra bucks and see this one in three-dimensions."
rotten," Ultimately, a handful of eye-popping Yimou flourishes can't compensate for filmmaking so line-toeing and occasionally cartoonish that it makes the idea of a wall between Hollywood and Chinese interests actually sound kinda great."
fresh, Refreshingly weird romance.
rotten," The cast is cute and the action is colorful, but the comedy isn't as captivating as it sets out to be."
fresh, This Jake Gyllenhaal buddy/cop drama features some of the best on-screen banter in years. 
rotten, Ohhhhhhhh --- the waste! A really decent premise gets reduced to a cliched script with very little humor. 
fresh," A shame that it ends on this one false note, but up to that point 3.10 To Yuma fairly races along."
rotten, In the end V for Vendetta is as cold and unsympathetic as the regime it criticizes.
rotten, Melinda and Melinda revolves around neurotic and selfish characters who are unappealing in every way.
rotten," Never quite coheres . . . But Gilliam has still made an admirable--and, at times, daring--oddity . . . disturbingly different from most celluloid childhoods."
rotten, Freya is given the barest veil of a backstory while Ravenna just oozes ribbons of black bile (literally) for her own evil reasons. These women may be strong but they are never deep.
rotten, Attractive actors can't redeem a sodden script.
fresh," [Judy Davis and Kevin Spacey] play this strident high comedy duet with a self-sustaining brio that easily puts them on the level of the stars of Twentieth Century, The Awful Truth, The Philadelphia Story, and His Girl Friday."
fresh," Not as funny as the first film, but the story is richer, more emotionally complex and better written."
rotten," The rumours are true, this is one of the worst films of the year."
rotten," Instead of engaging us with a good plot, Anderson turns Afterlife into a visual and audio showcase. The film is literally an hour and a half music video jam-packed with uninspired Nine Inch Nails riffs and drumbeats."
rotten," The thing is just a clunky and tasteless and dumb scare picture, isn't it? Clunky, yes. Tasteless, for sure. But not so dumb I fear."
rotten," By stripping an action thriller this close to the bone, director William Friedkin has removed too much meat."
fresh," Smart movies offer intriguing setups, unique characters and tantalizing plot pirouettes. The Accountant is a smart movie. Smart movies also avoid offering imbecilic narrative coincidences and imploding third acts. Alas, The Accountant isn't THAT smart."
fresh," It's very funny and very smart, much like its creator."
fresh," As every creative artist knows, truth can reside as easily in fiction as in fact, and although [Adrian] Crowley's stories have the ring of truth, the format in which they are presented is deliberately staged, playful. "
fresh," Lacking the over-polished zing of Juno or the heft of either of Reitman's previous offerings, Young Adult is nonetheless an interesting pseudo-comedy that dares to add depth to its characters instead of just having them be assholes for laughs."
fresh," Many with loathe it, but hopefully, just as many will love it."
fresh," Seraphine is rare in its sympathetic focus on a laborer, yet refined in its execution."
fresh," McKay and co-writer Dave Henchy keep on pumping out gags; their movie often looks like a 107-minute comedy sketch, and I laughed throughout."
rotten," 'Cowboys & Aliens' is a bland, faceless, callow, moronic, poorly assembled action movie that felt more like playing with plastic cowboys and Indians than shooting an actual gun."
fresh," Casey Affleck's high, raspy voice almost sinks this violent film."
rotten," Wannabe film students and hipster cinephiles are the target audience for this crude, vulgar, gross comedy."
fresh," With so much invested in this film, Gracie represents the culmination of a family dream, so you can't really blame it for wearing its heart on its sleeve."
fresh," Raw, original and timely, please be sure to treat yourself to Tangerine."
fresh," Echoes too much of ""The Rider"" to really stand on its own."
fresh," The plot mechanics are predictable, but the atmosphere and sensitivity to teenage fears are not: stage actress Leontine Sagan brings an exceptionally warm touch to her depiction of female friendships."
rotten, a humiliating mess
fresh," An absorbing, touching examination of the loss of innocence that, despite occasionally drifting towards the sappy, undeniably deserves its place in the heart of a generation."
rotten, a two-hour in-joke that is rarely dull but only occasionally as funny as it thinks it is. 
rotten," The script lacks wit, and the in-joke references to cinematic sci-fi classics will soar over little kids' heads without pleasing many adults."
rotten, For those who remember [his Allen's classic films] Cassandra's Dream seems like the work of an imposter.
rotten, ... more interesting (albeit disheartening) for what it seems to say about public-school teachers ... 
rotten, The movie is a pain in the sarcophagus. I fear that it will anger the gods.
rotten," It does a lot of things well, but nothing extraordinarily. The end result is a solidly middle-of-the-road - and thus forgettable - bit of slapsticky animation."
fresh," The heartfelt charm of the movie lies in the impressive performances, not just from the two biggest names... but from the skaters cast to play a role they know like the back of their hand."
rotten," I admire the boldness and vision of this film, but ultimately it fails on almost every level."
rotten," With all the convolutions, this is still the kind of ho-hum movie that will allow you to catch up on your bill paying when you finally catch it on HBO."
fresh, Killer Instinct and Public Enemy can't escape the shadow of the films they might have been. Both earn their place in the gangster canon. But not even Jacques Mesrine can escape the constraints of cinema.
fresh, Ms. Theron has ventured far beyond mere surface impersonation -- although that is startling enough -- to an insightful penetration of her subject's psyche.
rotten," A man leaving the screening said the film was better than Saving Private Ryan. He may have meant the Internet short Saving Ryan's Privates. But Windtalkers doesn't beat that one, either."
fresh, Director Paddy Breathnach reveals a sensitive touch with the material.
fresh, The best kids' holiday movie in years.
rotten, Room domesticates repugnant horror with spiritual uplift. 
fresh, Bertolucci's best film for a long time.
fresh," The title of this movie should be 'Avengers: Infinity War Part One,' because that is what it is. It is not a movie that stands on its own. It is a leaning monolith that would fall flat without 'Part Two' to lean against."
fresh," The movie is nonsense, but it does achieve a brazenly chic high style -- black-on-black, airborne, spasmodic."
rotten," It is, quite plainly, like watching a movie that's trying to go out of its way to be horrible."
fresh," Washington directed as well as starred, and it is clear he has no trouble wearing both hats at once"
fresh," It is an entertaining and acceptable film, but... at times gives the feeling that we are facing a succession of Hollywood patterns. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh," With a good character, a cat, and a few choice folk songs, the Coens have created one of the more authentic portraits of the torment, joy and anxiety of an artist's life."
fresh, I suppose the basic truth of this film - that support of terrorism negates all shred of political virtue - is too powerful to ignore.
rotten," There are simply too many loose ends to distract us, and too much empty air in which audiences can't help but poke holes."
fresh, Dark and twisty indie drama.
rotten, Aronofsky's ethnic denial and escape into Nina's psychological trauma actually trivializes her artistic pursuit. Turning art into genre movie silliness is a careerist's dance.
fresh," Pinkett Smith does just fine. She's sexy, funny and ironic and carries Woo as it ambles all over a Brooklyn night that's one long party."
fresh," The film doesn't lead me to bouts of depression and thoughts of suicide as it apparently does other fans, but it's clearly no match for the first two titles."
rotten," A huge, noisy mess."
fresh, Gil still believes in magic and Golden Ages and idolizes the writers and artists of the Lost Generation the way some boys worship Kobe Bryant and Peyton Manning. 
rotten," Owen and Binoche are both strong actors, but they can't salvage this bran muffin of a movie."
rotten, Imagine if someone remade The Others...with Casper the Friendly Ghost. That should give you a pretty good idea what Cameron Crowe has done with Vanilla Sky.
fresh," Sillier than the Singer versions, Ratner's movie is also -- for this less-than-reverent X-Men fan -- more satisfying."
rotten," Less a spirited defense of tolerance and equality than a facile, only fitfully funny burlesque."
fresh," An entertaining and inspiring movie with great acting, narratice and an epic portrayal of a significant moment in music. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten," As lazy, bloated and TV-screen- friendly as shameless promos come."
rotten," Though children will mostly be enthralled by the spectacles, even they might notice the weak story protruding through the industrial magic."
rotten," If all you need is a fix of puerile smut and puddle-deep romantic giggles and can't wait for the next episode of Two and a Half Men, The Ugly Truth should do the trick. "
rotten," Poor pacing, stale writing and pretentious parade of cameos (wait for the one in the elevator) produce a film and a main character that aren't interesting, relatable or humorous."
rotten," Over-stylized in its production value and underdeveloped in the cynicism department, this inflated and laden vehicle reminds us that school is out both literally and figuratively."
fresh, Zombieland is an hilarious jaunt through a futuristic America ravaged by a contagion that has changed all but a lucky few into flesh-chomping predators.
rotten," A group of charming and talented actors are forced to portray some of the most smug, annoying and thoroughly unlikable characters ever seen in a film not made by Henry Jaglom or Ed Burns."
rotten," It's a shame because the idea behind Planetarium is interesting, and the visual style in the opening credits is promising, but the storytelling lacks presence, which makes it not much more than a collection of pretty but vacuous sequences."
rotten," In spite of our modern electronic wizardry and our technological advancements in animation, movies still need a good story to tell; otherwise, it's all just flashing lights."
fresh," Approximately 15 parts fun escapism and one part reflection. In a culture that's obsessed with unearthing obscure references, it will be interesting to see how the movie's fans-and I think there will be many-process the conflicting messages, if at all. "
rotten," This film is indeed Limited -- in appeal, sincerity and substance."
fresh," Pacino, Lemmon, Harris, and Baldwin are masters of their craft, and Mamet's dynamite play rewards them accordingly."
fresh," There's no mistaking The Royal Tenenbaums for being anything other than a Wes Anderson film, and that is most certainly a compliment."
rotten," Just like its struggling athletic heroine, ""Swing Away"" develops a case of the yips."
fresh, ...a terrific film that smacks you upside the head.
rotten," All this is presented in an expensive, good-looking film that is well-made by Scott Derrickson, but to no avail."
rotten, The movie is nothing more than a labored series of skits that play like ideas from rejected TV pilots.
fresh," Golden Globe nominee Kevin Spacey has a ball and then some playing the devil inside Jack Abramoff, the corrupt GOP lobbyist who ran wild during the W. years. "
fresh," Zwick and his writing partners, Marshall Herskovitz and Charles Randolph, overextend their scope by a wide margin."
rotten, If you recognize Zeus (the dog from Snatch) it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one.
fresh," The wheels within wheels of sly tale-spinning turn quietly, turn deep."
rotten, The film undermines its own drama by waiting until the final seconds to inform the audience of what we're supposed to have spent the last 110 minutes caring about.
fresh," If calculated catharsis does not annoy you, then The Light Between Oceans could be the late summer movie for you."
rotten, Teen musical remake has edgy content for a PG movie.
rotten, It's relatively painless to null one's relationship with such a pic and that's what I imagine most critics and many a viewer will likely do after sitting through all 94-some minutes of this film. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)
rotten," Any good will the movie generates is grated right back off by Black, whose obnoxiousness has lost whatever charm it once possessed."
fresh," Easily Affleck's best directed film yet, Argo also ticks off a number of boxes on the Best Picture nominee checklist: grand scope, historical basis, uplifting story of human triumph. The movie's great escape sequence goes a little overboard,though."
rotten, As hollow as Justin Timberlake lyrics.
rotten," ""Hangover"" for the college crowd, but it's a pale imitation."
fresh," At once eerie, picaresque, evocative, and utterly alien to the reality most viewers inhabit, Into Great Silence is a daring and breathtakingly constructed documentary dream."
fresh," Despite studio interference, it's still a decent film, and the association of a black man and a Jewish woman (as two outcasts) is a welcome addition to the genre. "
fresh, This is the work of professionals acknowledging a good story and knowing better than to get in the way.
fresh," With The Devil's Candy, Byrne confirms his status as a filmmaker to watch."
rotten," Bay has simply botched the job. His action sequences, especially those on the asteroid, are impenetrable and chaotic. And the narrative, larded with the usual military double-cross, is preposterous."
rotten," History's most famous thief-apologies to the Ocean siblings-gets another big screen reinvention, but really, the makers have merely tinkered under the Hood."
fresh, It's an odd film but an entertaining one.
fresh," Utiliza un estilo clásico, directo, con mucha atención al detalle y a los efectos individuales de un infierno colectivo."
fresh, Errol Morris' documentary... should be seen by all Americans but probably will viewed only by a relative handful.
rotten," Half-witted it may be, but as back-to-school time-killers go, Accepted's right on the edge of acceptable."
fresh, It treks even deeper into the maw for an imaginative and terrifying look at the prism of online identity.
fresh," In the end, Kendrick, Lively, Feig's direction, and the sunny Connecticut exteriors and stunning tasteful rich interiors are diverting enough and perhaps worth a matinee ticket. But the script only has a single good act."
rotten," Haggis has tackled his own penchant for heavy-handedness with a typically heavy hand. Those who groaned through Crash will find plenty to groan about here, too."
fresh," Fast Color gives us a look into a new age of superhero films, where powers are used to compliment simple but powerful human stories."
rotten," Why would anyone (especially a filmmaker of [Susan] Lacy's talents) bother making such a lengthy piece of surface level fan service, again telling us how hard Jaws was to film? "
rotten, There's just far too much going on; too much for the film to be believable.
fresh," As the tea turns to champagne and they talk about their mortality and the indignities of aging, the four women stop being famous actresses and seem like any other group of old friends."
rotten," ""Final Girl"" isn't about building sympathies or establishing motives, it's purely concentrated on creating a pretty picture. Characters always come secondary to style, deflating the entire effort."
rotten," The world of ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2"" is a cleverly-conceived one, the design of the film is engaging on all levels, and the voice cast is great. It's the story that fails to engage beyond the glittering surface."
fresh, An intriguing piece of humanistic cinema.
rotten," I thought it was a complete mess. I thought the teenage dialogue was puerile and that was a shame because Daniel Waters wrote the screenplay for HEATHERS, which is one of the really nice films about school but that was a long time ago."
fresh," tricky, brash, and brisk "
fresh," It is alternately tender, sad and smart. It's also very funny."
fresh," This is entertaining stuff, and Sam Raimi has spun a good yarn for the summer."
fresh," The directors push no agendas, but they also pull no punches. They show the soldiers in their bravest moments, most vulnerable and frightened moments, and even their most frighteningly bloodthirsty moments."
rotten, Maybe it's time to focus on coming up with new classics instead of constantly returning to the old ones?
rotten," Ambitious to a fault, this is a slightly serviceable story of murder that features strong performances, but little more than that."
fresh," A magical, compelling, funny and emotional piece of cinema. "

rotten, It would be easy to laugh off if it wasn't so clearly a comment on historical reality.
fresh," The production is very well done, especially for the time."
fresh," While Kenneth Branagh's latest incarnation can't rival Sidney Lumet's original 1974 version for its all-star credentials, it is by far the more enjoyable and cinematic interpretation... "
fresh, ... a fascinating exploration into the ways that guilt can manifest itself ... a mind-boggling two hours.
fresh," What makes it work are the performers, particularly Mullan and Horrocks, who give it their considerable all."
fresh, A philosophical thriller filled with modernist cool.
rotten, The only fingerprint the film leaves is the one that adorns its one-sheet.
fresh, The problem with making the title character into a happily married good guy is that he is not despicable any more. He is therefore much less interesting than the villain.
fresh, Elaborate and inventive!
fresh," A sleekly assembled and intriguing project, if clearly a very commercial proposition."
fresh," The film, which argues that blood brotherhood is stronger than political brotherhoods, vibrates with their youthful energy and ardor."
rotten," If some more effort was paid to ensure the rest of the characters were more rounded, perhaps the film could have warranted a watch. "
fresh," Carp about it all you want, but as Hollywood revisions of ancient writing go, Beowulf beats nonsense like Troy and 300 on all fronts: formally, thematically and intellectually."
rotten," Throwing technical finesse at the emptiest vision conceivable, director McG ups the ante on how closely a movie can approach tween-music flavourlessness."
fresh, Hard to tell if Woody's schoolboyish crush on Spain (Gaudí! Miro! Flamenco!) rivals his one on Johansson but both are equally embarrassing.
rotten," An incomplete exercise that lacks crucial emotional brushstrokes despite a rich palette and a piano-heavy score, At Eternity's Gate still offers the thrill of being inside an artistic process, adoringly interpreted."
rotten, East meets West in this less-than-special documentary.
rotten," This feels a lot like a swan song, with everything wrapped up in a nice little package. Maybe that's for the best."
rotten," It often feels like a dream -- specifically, someone else's, a nonlinear, illogical synapse explosion that's always fascinating to the person in whose head it detonated but not so much to those experiencing it secondhand."
fresh," Benh Zeitlin's debut feature is part film, part hallucination: a ripe and gamey piece of what you might call Apocalyptic Southern Gothic, ambitious and flawed but sprinting with energy."
fresh, It doesn't rely on annoying pop references or scenes of shameless schmaltz. Credit is probably due to executive producer Guillermo del Toro.
rotten, Casa de los Babys is probably the biggest misstep of [Sayles's] long career
fresh," Warth has created an astonishing calling card - an earnest and entertaining celebration of process and performance, not to mention a tremendous showcase for two homegrown actors on the cusp of greatness."
rotten," This bittersweet, multilingual romantic comedy is just as fluffy and forgettable as its title suggests."
fresh," Luckily, Hardy is there to pick up the pieces... this is possibly Hardy's most ambitious role to date and the Brit is magnificently enticing as both Reggie and Ronnie Kray. "
fresh," Raw is a beautifully told tale that is gruesome and, as a woman, very familiar. "
rotten," The comedy is too frantically paced, and you can sense the cast trying hard - in some cases, too hard - in a futile effort to somehow elevate the erratic material to greatness."
fresh," Liam Neeson has spent so many years bringing class and gravitas to otherwise undeserving films (ahem, the Taken series) that it's nice to see him in a movie more befitting his talents."
fresh, Ranks among the all-time heavyweights of sports movies.
rotten, I think this is the seventh animated film in a row that's about a bunch of animals on a death-defying journey from Point A to Point B.
rotten," All this is rendered with pedestrian animation, deadly dialogue, and a general air of indifference, as if the whole thing was the result of a late-night bet, or a joke gone horribly wrong."
fresh," It's not a John Wayne movie, and Hopalong Cassidy would've fled screaming from this set. Instead, it's a horror western for the modern age that uses the most realistic scares "
rotten," At Any Price has an interesting story at its core, but it's bogged down by undeveloped characters and sideplots, as well as a poorly-written third act."
fresh," How do you make a movie about immobility? For a hyperactive stylist like Boyle, whose movies are at best thrillingly kinetic and at worst represent death by a thousand cuts, the solution turns out to be absurdly simple. He heads inward."
rotten, Hokey and slapdash.
rotten," Why do once great actors attach themselves to a dog of a picture like this? Surely they still have standards? Alas, their judgment seems to be fading . . ."
rotten," The movie's visual pleasures and idiosyncrasies may make for lively animation, but as a narrative film, ""Virus Tropical"" feels more like a sketch."
rotten," A weird combination of saccharine drama with ""Footloose,"" deadly earnest but utterly incredible, the good intentions overwhelmed by silly theatrics."
fresh," An intriguing piece of work that captures an underexplored side of modern Japan and provides sex workers with a rare chance to speak for themselves, this is a gem of a documentary, and well worth seeking out."
rotten," Its 'Saturday Night Live'-esque parade of improbable celebrity impersonations kept me entertained: You'd probably have to attend a Halloween party hosted by Turner Classic Movies to find a less convincing John Wayne, Kirk Douglas or Edward G. Robinson."
rotten," Stone is to be commended for showing the high-stakes world of Wall Street without glamorizing it, even if his approach is at times heavy-handed."
rotten," Whatever points Pride and Glory was trying to make have been buried beneath layers of clumsy, good-vs.-bad posturings and peppered with R-rated language that's clearly supposed to remind us of films like The Departed."
rotten, No fanboy will feel 'Thor' for spending his hard-earned money on the latest of superhero from the Marvel universe. 
fresh," Fans were horrified when Sylvester Stallone managed to turn the declarative statement ""I am the law!"" into a hammy punchline. Those same folks will now be delighted to learn that Karl Urban has reclaimed the snatch of dialogue for them."
fresh, It can still hold its own against the new generation of horror films still sourcing it. Well worth a look.
fresh," Like the movie she's in, Olive is smart, sarcastic, and never snarky."
rotten, ...a garden-variety zombie movie that boasts few attributes designed to separate it from its legion of competitors.
rotten," Even with the drugs and the gambling and a host of oddballs who are thankfully never romanticized to the point of nausea, the film is ultimately much too sanitary for its own good."
rotten, A truly excruciating journey...a feel-good movie that's bound to make you feel absolutely awful.
rotten," In Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, the director's subject is as blatant and consistent as his cluttered mise-en-scène."
rotten," I Love You, Beth Cooper provides so few laughs I nearly wandered out of the theater midway to go look for some somewhere."
rotten," Overstuffed and distractible, this episodic redo feels like a couple episodes of some Showtime series stitched into a feature ..."
rotten," There is nothing to Stella's character -- or any of these characters, for that matter -- that you can relate to."
fresh," The Conjuring is an especially well-crafted horror movie made almost entirely from practical effects, which is increasingly refreshing to see."
fresh, A top-notch cast (including standout Sennia Nanua) makes this zombie drama well worth checking out.
fresh," A smart, savvy exploration of lust and power in the long-running battle of the sexes. "
rotten," Big sets, wall-to-wall mayhem and hi-tech pixelry only go so far in a movie sure to leave anyone with fond memories of the original feeling shortchanged."
rotten," Badly directed, horribly scripted, dismal mess of a film that is every bit as bad as you've heard. Poor, poor Halle Berry."
fresh," Well researched and put together, this is important stuff."
rotten," Whereas the gorgeous, sophisticated Ratatouille was both a crowd-pleaser and a critical favorite, duly winning the Academy Award for best animated feature, Despereaux feels obvious, preachy and heavy-handed."
fresh," The film creates its effects essentially out of visuals and music. It is meditative. It does not cater to us, but wants to inspire us, enlarge us."
rotten," A Disney toon seemingly born solely from a bad pun, this computer-animated trifle pieces together its Bard adaptation from the spare parts of superior Shakespeare-for-kids predecessors."
rotten, An almost unbearably twee story about pursuing a dream.
rotten," In going after a ""Seabiscuit"" type of movie about the famous '30s amateur golfer Bobby Jones, the filmmakers chose a double epithet for a biopic that gets nowhere near that film's captivating sports story from the same era."
rotten, The vision here is that of producers with eyes on box office and little concern for creativity.
rotten," This is a little too slick and commanding for its own good; despite Crowe and DiCaprio's best efforts, their characters keep getting flattened by the steamroller narrative."
rotten," Monsters, Inc. was in no way calling for a sequel, and here it is."
rotten," Redacted, director Brian DePalma's ugly little Iraq War movie, wastes an interesting approach on trite, crude and painfully superficial content."
rotten, Why would a distributor suddenly yank an animated family film from its intended wide December opening until mid-January? Could it be that the advance word of mouth wasn't very good-winked?
fresh," There are also moments to make historians wince, most especially a third-act chronology that egregiously conflates details of Loudoun Hill with the Battle of Bannockburn seven years later. But Outlaw King gets far more right than it ever gets wrong. "
rotten," The best that can be said is that it's a 'cute' and 'harmless' kids' movie, as long as you ignore the moment when Yogi tells the lovestruck Mr. Ranger that the best way to woo a mate is to urinate on her. "
rotten, The main takeaway of Manolo: The Boy Who Made Shoes for Lizards is that Manolo Blahnik makes really great shoes.
rotten," Director Roland Emmerich has a knack for belaboring a point, explaining everything to us in dialogue and visuals often and repeatedly and over and over."
fresh," Master movie muckraker Moore retraces the final days of the Columbine shooters, in an alternately sordid and absurd trail that ends up encompassing a culpable media and a wacky gun love culture."
fresh, '80s film remake delivers clean laughs geared toward kids.
fresh," Anthony Quinn plays with impressive savagery and assurance as Zampano; and it is a mark of his quality that, for all the character's unmitigated brutality, he makes it seem touchingly helpless."
rotten, It all feels too simplistic.
fresh, Doesn't go the whole distance. But it's a start.
fresh," Without giving a lot away, you'll be creeped a handful of times."
fresh," Caught between real quality and heritage for export, the film falls between two disparate stools."
fresh, A delightful and totally refreshing drama about a book club who become a community of supportive friends as they weather the changes and challenges in their lives.
fresh, It is a poignant reminder of how intellect and desire do not simply disappear once we get older.
rotten," The chemistry between Skye and Astin is based entirely on grueling, non-stop referential dialogue, as if neither of them has forgotten a word of Kierkegaard, Tennyson, or Cobain."
rotten," Thank goodness for Martin Freeman, who makes Bilbo a feeling person & a hobbit. Otherwise, the film is so awed by its technical ingenuity that character and story fade away. "
fresh," Fully dedicated to finding newer and more creative ways to annihilate countless bad guys, Michael Davis' ultimate guy movie isn't just testosterone-heavy, it's doused with it, sprayed with diesel, and set ablaze."
rotten, Where The A-Team falters so resoundingly is in its belief that spectacle equals suspense. 
rotten, Hitman loses steam as we realize what is supposed to happen and we don't get enough bold surprises along the way.
rotten," Venom's almost worth watching for Tom Hardy's bizarre accent and whirling-dervish mania alone, but it's a shame he's not surrounded by a better, more exciting film."
rotten, Dead Man is surprisingly bland. And it becomes more dull -- and more grotesque -- as it moves along.
fresh," The shift in dynamic makes for a lot of Predator-esque monster fun, while Roberts's 1970s influences, in particular Apocalypse Now, make this Kong movie a true giant. "
fresh," There are plenty of characters and plenty of action to go around, yet thanks to its strong sense of suspense, Catching Fire doesn't feel as long as its near-two-and-a-half-hour running time might suggest."
fresh," It's a tense time in a confined space and director Dan Trachtenberg, taking his cue from Alfred Hitchcock (who would have loved the premise of this film), keeps tightening the screws until the final big reveal."
rotten," One of the vilest and most disgusting films I've ever seen. It's too concerned with being cool, brutal and shocking, not being GOOD."
rotten," As with the lady's neighbors, this movie doesn't know what to do with her."
rotten," As Untraceable descends into the progressively more perverted territory, it begins to practice the very hypocrisy it condemns in its audience, engaging in the rancid voyeurism it pretends to abhor."
rotten, Taissa Farmiga deserves better.
rotten, The show seemed like a slowly deflating balloon.
rotten," Too often, characters feel the need to tell us exactly what they're doing and why. And then they take an awfully long time to get there."
rotten," There are plenty of jokes, but they're almost all stale, in bad taste, or simply not funny (usually all three)."
fresh," Everything you want an underdog story to be: suspenseful, inspirational, heartfelt and, ultimately, uplifting. It will make you stand up and cheer! A slam dunk!"
rotten, Ejemplo claro de lo que no se debe hacer a la hora de escribir un guión. 
fresh," With a name like Kick-Ass, you know what you're in for. Or maybe you don't, and that's the beauty of this gloriously entertaining superhero satire."
fresh," ""Contemporary Color"" is a gift to audiences everywhere, a spectacular kinetic pinwheel of a movie that whisks us away from big issues to celebrate an exceptional creative collaboration ..."
rotten," Wins points for ambition, but doesn't survive Ahmed's stiff execution. It's dark but never profound, while the rest of the effort struggles to achieve consistency, leaving laughs and emotion in short supply. "
rotten," Without any sense of mystery, danger or fun, this superficial concept plays like an elaborate, expensive prologue for future films in the 'Dark Universe' franchise."
fresh, The genial comedy reaches for understated satirical moments.
fresh," With these orgasmic shootouts putting the f*ck into clusterf*ck, perverse desires transmute low genre into pure gold"
fresh," It is a likable, warm film that brings a welcome reassurance: Even if you fail spectacularly as a comedian or as a human being, it really can turn out OK in the end."
fresh, What unfolds in Pesce's brisk nail-biter is a psycho-sexual power play in which the roles of victim and hunter constantly shift. 
fresh," Verhoeven masterfully stretches the suspense, and his gallows humor lands most of the time. His attempts at edginess slide into exploitation, though."
fresh," An enchanting return visit to the Wizarding World with stunning set design, an engaging story, and masterful performances."
rotten," Tackles a worthy subject and has its heart in the right place, but it's still highly problematic for a variety of reasons."
rotten," Hanks and Roberts clearly seem up for a work-out, but this dull rom-com holds any potential chemistry at the mercy of poor jokes, a meandering plot and unlikeable supporting characters."
rotten," You doubt Wiseman's sense of pacing. Still, he must have had a good time shooting."
fresh, What's present is okay. I just wish someone could have traveled back in time and corrected the things that prevent 'About Time' from being great. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)
rotten," Missing the point of what true grindhouse fans are looking for, don't expect much life to be found in this stale, monotonous, mind-numbing tale, making Biehn's audience the sole victim in this whole debacle"
fresh," As an act of preservation, Frozen Time is a marvel, a miracle, a complete good. As an act of storytelling, it's still a bit too cold for the nitrate to catch fire."
rotten, Unconnected shreds of plot suggest severe editing at some stage and neither characters nor musical routines add up to much.
rotten," When, in the last few minutes, Cuthbert finally slipped her bonds and began looking for her tormentors, I knew exactly how she felt."
rotten, A grossout comedy that parties hard
fresh," Exciting, nerve-wracking and utterly original."
rotten," Now, if only they had replaced Mark Wahlberg, too, because he's acting in a far blander picture than Plummer and co-star Michelle Williams."
rotten," Wilson and Page are compelling and Slade demonstrates a slick stylistic flair, but the over over-the-top shock pandering renders the dark lesson convoluted and hard to swallow."
rotten," A melancholic alternation of bitter and comedic sketches, all resolutely low-key and wildly uneven. "
rotten," It's one of the loudest , most aurally assaultive films I've ever seen. Some audience members will see that as a positive."
fresh, 12 Years a Slave is an outstanding triumph in filmmaking since it's so unbelievably captivating yet will leave you feeling so undeniably uncomfortable as it takes pride in ripping your mortality to shreds over the course of two hours.
rotten," A strange and unfortunate mixture of comedy, melodrama and fantasy. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh, Revealing. Fascinating. Entertaining.
rotten," A mushy, shortcut-laden yawn quite apart from the film from which it stole its material."
rotten," As the saying goes, don't judge a book by its cover. In this case, don't let the star names fool you."
rotten," Cruise's name on the marquee is plenty to insure the success of the film, even if it is lopsided, shallow, and slips the audience a Mickey Finn at the outset."
rotten," 'The Mechanic' is kind of a remake of a 1970s-era Charles Bronson movie. And it's kind of a vehicle for Jason Statham, who has cemented his reputation as a tough-guy action star in the 'Transporter' and 'Crank' series."
fresh, A particularly high point for mid-2010's art cinema.
fresh," You might not want to live here, but the imagery makes for a nice postcard."
rotten," The problem is, the movie doesn't really care if we are laughing with it or at it."
fresh," Although its not always effective, Beast is an interesting thriller. [Full Review in Spanish]"
fresh," Due to the herculean task of adaptation, ""The Glass Castle"" lacks the emotional potency of Cretton's earlier work and the unflinching detail of Walls' memoir."
rotten," The political ambitions of le Carré and ... Meirelles are quite insistent, but the story feels like a story, not like the truth-it's both far-fetched and predictable."
rotten," [A] graphically depressing, downward spiral to hell."
fresh," Remember, this isn't Lewis Carroll in any way, shape or form. It's a sugary cake with EAT ME on it, and ""I'm better than the last one"" in necessary small print."
fresh, A terrifically quirky and entertaining character comedy that's pure sunshine itself.
rotten," Saw VI doesn't come close to reigniting the spark of the original, but at least it approaches coherence, which is more than can be said for the last several installments of the series."
fresh," Jackson would surely concede that the act of slowing and colouring in the archive film is a means to an end. It is a way of bringing the story of the men who fought 100 years ago back to life, and it works brilliantly."
rotten," As these parallel supernatural mysteries begin to meld into one another, all semblance of credibility dissolves, leaving behind an impenetrable and frustrating fog of unanswered questions."
fresh," The tension between the bleak and the blithe, the prime source of this movie's strength, is sustained by Reitman to the end."
fresh, One of the greatest comedies of the year. [full review in Spanish]

rotten," In this documentary, media columnist David Carr practically becomes the face of The New York Times"
fresh, The star packs his guitars and goes on tour recovering a magic that seemed unrecoverable to thank us for staying there. [Full Review in Spanish]
fresh," It's great to see extensive interview footage with the relaxed and funny author, but Philip Roth: Unmasked shies away from controversy and, as a result, feels a bit sanitized."
fresh," Welcome back, Chris Rock."
rotten," As fresh as [Gatlif's] view of flamenco may be, his dramatic ideas are excruciatingly trite."
fresh," I would argue that, in a bizarre way, Mr. Tarantino empowers women as no action-genre director before him ever has."
rotten, The movie's mores can feel cluelessly retro as the ever-dithering Bridget lurches between one man and another.
rotten," 13 (Tzameti) might seem allegorical, but it's too cynically concerned with what works as entertainment to offer larger truths about human existence."
rotten," Knightley's searing performance, makes the stumbling script and filmmaking all the more confounding. How could such naked and rich material get such a woefully mediocre touch?"
rotten," Featuring an atrocious script, weak acting, lazy direction, and even worse editing, it fails to entertain and doesn't even qualify under the so-bad-it's-good category."
rotten, How a sweet story about a boy and his dog turns into a lame thriller about backwoods weapons dealing is anyone's guess.
fresh," As a chilly tale of a young woman striving to escape her family and her claustrophobic small town, it succeeds on its own merits."
rotten," That Elvis or Nixon might believe his own mythology, the stories told him by his yes men, can't be surprising. Neither is the movie's underlining of their hypocrisies."
rotten, So turgid and enervated that it's more likely to generate snores than shudders.
fresh, An insightful and thought-provoking doc that will enrage and frustrate after digestion.
fresh, It's not great - it's no 'The Magnificent Seven' - but it'll satisfy any varmint hungry for some Old West justice.
rotten," ... inert and has no sense of flow, and this despite the wavy dramatic effect caused by the three-part scrunching."
fresh," Payne constructs a hilarious ode to middle America and middle age with this unlikely odyssey, featuring a pathetic, endearing hero who is all too human."
fresh," Cernan is proud of what he accomplished, calling himself the luckiest man in the world for all that he got to see. But he also expresses regret at having done it at the expense of his family."
fresh, The brilliance of Leave No Trace lies in its understatement.
rotten," It's clever, or at least clever enough to keep you going and interested from start to finish. It just isn't scary."
rotten, Everything from the costumes to the action to the script to the terrible acting was so misguided.
rotten," There's really nothing to enjoy here other than a lot of stale dialogue, and a pitiful grab for a franchise."
fresh," Employing the murky plot construction of a story within a story within a story, The Words is well acted, thoughtful and too clever by half. "
fresh," Amongst a field of analysis which examines Scientology as a cabal of rich wackos gone wild on the taxpayer's dime, Going Clear thrives."
rotten, ...an ambitious but ultimately ineffective debut endeavor. 
fresh," ...in the messy but often dazzling Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, Rowling rains down so much lore we may need a semester at Hogwarts to keep up."
rotten, So thoroughly sanitized that it's essentially wiped of personality.
fresh," A snapshot of consuming obsession and the inspiring power of art that?s like falling into a bewildering, beguiling dream."
fresh, Observe and Report is a lot better when it's being funny than when it's rummaging in the shadows.
fresh, ... riveting stuff ...
rotten, Its clunky incidents of exposition leave us with no real understanding of what anyone is thinking or feeling.
fresh, The third film is no more flawed and probably in a league with the first two.
rotten, The novelty quickly fades since -- you guessed it -- the story's just not there.
fresh," It succeeds at times in spite of itself, though it ultimately adds up to less than the sum of its sometimes impressive, sometimes insufferable parts."
fresh," It may be a marketing nightmare, but as examinations of mortality go, few come funnier, wiser or more astutely acted."
rotten," It's a pleasant enough expression of a series of familiar story beats, but apart from a few brief action-sequence moments, it could hardly be more rote or vanilla."
rotten," When it comes to mining boys' adventure stories, defaming pirates may be fair game, but stories about western justice and native Americans? Not so much."
fresh, Somewhat gets the series back on track.
fresh, The debut feature from Sydney independent filmmaker Platon Theodoris is a precisely executed character study with a comic and darkly fantastical bent. 
rotten," Marvel at the desperate spectacle of three comic leads ... being outperformed by the wide-eyed Robinson, a quiet collector of silences."
fresh," Fascinating and frustrating in equal measures, In This Corner of the World offers a compelling look at life in Japan during and directly after wartime, with a rich female character at the center, but it's also maddeningly choppy."
rotten, ... a deadly dull narrative about four depressed stereotypes who spend an hour and a half going from unhappy to slightly less unhappy.
fresh," XX does many somethings right, whether it's dazzling us with striking visual aesthetics, gripping us by the throat, or cutting through to the centers of our humanity."
fresh, Celebrates both classic horror movies and the love between a mother and daughter.
rotten," The movie makes virtually every mistake in the book, including flagrantly violating the moral of their own story."
fresh," It feels like a comic book, It feels like its ripped off the page."
rotten," Sloppy, overheated, sometimes involving, ultimately shallow. Read the book--skip the movie."
rotten," While doing fine work otherwise, Carly Schroeder is never able to elevate the athletics of the role to make us believe the guys aren't taking it easy on her."
fresh, This latest movie has a formula that's rare for summer blockbusters: smart and engrossing plot + a barrage of big-budget special effects = an overwhelmingly good time.
fresh," It might not be much easier to buy than a 1950s True Detective comic, but this is as slick and explosive as a barrel of high-octane hair oil."
fresh," Unjustifiably long and with misplaced humour throughout, The Last Jedi nonetheless delivers some scintillating action, spine-tingling lore and a loving farewell to Fisher. "
rotten, Ultimately stumbles and falls when over-long narrative veers off in a bizarre direction in the final reel.
fresh, An action-comedy that takes the bankrupt Bond genre out for a fresh and subversive airing.
fresh," Pettyfer's really got the whole tormented bit down pat; if he can master a few more expressions, he'll have a bright future in this town."
rotten," There's just enough to stop it from being a complete bore. But, come the end, you'll still think it wasn't worth your time. "
fresh," Hunt for the Wilderpeople tackles some fairly serious issues, but it handles those issues with just the right sense of the sweet."
rotten," The Burning Plain is missing a surprising and compelling story that packs an emotional punch, so Arriaga uses his signature style to distract you in the same way a magician would use the old sleight of hand practice."
fresh, Vividly chronicles the most dramatic space flight in history.
rotten, Concussion aims to be Brian's Song and ends up The Waterboy.
fresh," Dunn plays around with perspective and style, but all the flash doesn't obscure the film's emotion and heart, which are deep and true."
rotten, Brutal horror movie offers little to reflect on.
rotten," Holmes & Watson is a good idea that, sadly, writer/director Etan Cohen doesn't have a clue what to do with. "

rotten," While interesting as yet another Hollywood biblical/historical epic, it is disappointing, even meager, in  every other way."
rotten," Tries to be both an arty introspective super hero story and a summer extravaganza, and fails in both categories."

rotten," It's depressing that's not very good, given what an obvious, tangible passion project this is."
fresh," A cult hit waiting in the wings. Come for the brutal music, stay for the charming DIY optimism."
rotten, The script feels about ten re-writes short of being filmable.
fresh," There may be little that's remarkable about the documentary's construction, but there's no escaping the infectious spirit of its subjects, the important work of their teacher, and their shared love of music."
fresh," Even though the film won't fully commit to its more experimental flourishes, Hawke makes it feel truthful in a way that conventional music biopics rarely manage."
fresh," No, it doesn't deliver anything new. But it does bring back something old and for 100 minutes or so, that's enough."
rotten," Jesse Owens was a runner -- but that doesn't mean Race should run away from his story. Sadly, that's exactly what the new biopic about the track star does."
rotten," A 156-minute western with 30 minutes of plot, a gorgeous and well-acted series of grueling battles between man and man or man and nature that amount emotionally to nothing at all."
rotten, Just another in a long line of mercilessly unfunny spoofs.
fresh," Balances character, grit, spectacle and visceral action in a meaty, dramatically satisfying pie that delivers on the hype and will surprise many who felt the Hong Kong helmer progressively lost his mojo during his long years stateside."
fresh," In terms of fun, it ranks somewhere between a friendly game of beer pong and a raucous toga party. "
rotten," You can tell Hill could craft an entertaining film in a mode he's comfortable with, but aiming for profundity finds his reach exceeding his grasp."
fresh," Explodes with visionary ideas, adopting the language of dreams to explore and upend the very idea of storytelling. "
fresh," The friendship message that comes wrapped in the world of Wimpy Kid gives the movie its centre and its heart, along with a reminder that there is no greater act of devotion than a kid who will submit himself to the cheese touch for a pal."
fresh," This is a seriously weird comeback movie, and one that didn't necessarily need to feature the Goldie Hawn herself. But we'll take what we can get."
rotten," A refresher course in the perils of celebrity and activism, but its syllabus and insights are purely remedial."
fresh," Rachel Weisz, as a woman who risks everything for the love of the wrong man, carries the mood and subtext of the material safely tucked in her dressing-gown pocket -- she's vulnerable and self-motivated in all the right measures."
rotten," This movie probably isn't going to win anybody any awards. Still, it seems a logical conclusion that most people willing to part with their hard-earned cash would be expecting something great from a film called Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters."
rotten," A slight variation on a formula that, from Central Station to Kolya, has become all too familiar in the art houses."
rotten, The result is not altogether intoxicating.
fresh," When Niccol allows the movie to stop and breathe for a while, it's often powerful."
rotten," If you get bored during this film (I certainly did, despite all the eye candy on screen) you can amuse yourself by deciding which of the characters has the worst German accent. "
fresh," This is a mysterious, eerie, experience, whose resistance to easy interpretation (and freewheeling approach to source material) has something of Tarkovsky about it."
rotten," Larry Crowne is an amiable piece of fluff, but as a recession drama it lacks the bite of The Company Men, being too timid to criticise the forces that led to Larry's circumstances."
rotten," Usually when a movie includes so many interesting parts, it amounts to a pretty good time. However, the result here never gels."
fresh, Humpback Whales offers stunning shots that are both intimate and immense.
fresh," If you don't mind experiencing some feelings, this is an exceptional film."
rotten, Irritating one-note indie film.
rotten," Some of the pranks are masterfully executed; the beauty pageant and a disastrous funeral near the beginning stand out. But on the whole, ""Bad Grandpa"" can't locate a consistent groove."
fresh, The Forbidden Room is hard to explain but impossible to forget.
rotten, [It's] gallows grim but far too often unnecessarily heavy-handed in a way that drives home the factual historical horrors it portrays while somehow managing to feel like a sizably budgeted but no less maladroit television movie of the week.
rotten, Save that $11 and wait to see this one on Netflix.
rotten," Intentional or not, what kind of message does it send out that the studio's first African-American princess has to be relegated for the vast majority of screen time to the form of an amphibian?"
rotten," Brad Anderson's long-running saga of the melty-looking Winslow family and the gangling, interfering Great Dane that should've been put to sleep ages ago gets a film treatment."
fresh," Before you dismiss this as another 'cop gone bad' or 'guns blazing action flick,' you may want to hang on to your seat because this is an intense and gripping heist movie."
rotten," Black Panther turns racial politics into what Malcolm X called ""politricks"" . . . The media's enthusiasm for this bland action flick is maddening. The problem isn't one particular movie, but the celebration of the illusion of ""progress."""
fresh," Clooney, for his part, allows his movie star looks to go flabby and soft (all things being relative, of course), and he buries the performance way down in his gut."
rotten," Despite the film's undeniable technical achievements, it's hard to walk out of the theater without sensing that you've witnessed a bit of a cheat."
rotten," Watchmen should not have been made into a movie, at least not this movie, but I do hope you fanboys enjoy your three-hour music video of your favorite graphic novel. I am so disappointed in this film for its own sake."
fresh," The film, warm and sunshiny, examines the awkward limbo status between childhood and young adulthood with tart humor."
fresh, The movie plays like a cross between Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and It's a Wonderful Life.
rotten," There are moments of emotional beauty, of finding a way back after losing everything, but the film never remains focused long enough to provide true depth and the finale in particular leaves much to be desired. "
fresh," Early Tim Burton is creepy, dark fun for tweens and teens."
fresh," It's history and biography and, as Scorsese, Logan and Orson Welles before them affirm, a distinctly American story."
rotten, Turns one of the greatest geniuses of German literature into a love-struck rapscallion.
fresh, The great insight in director Roger Michell's fourth collaboration with writer Hanif Kureishi is its vision of Paris as an arena equally amenable to romantic comedy and sulking tragedy.
fresh," Alternately enraging and sorrowful, Hsiung's film sheds much needed light on a powerful and deeply important story of injustice."
fresh," Enjoyable as camp rather than as a manual for living, or even good filmmaking."
fresh," Although it often feels there's more of mechanics than the muse keeping Jack the Giant Slayer going, this sprightly fairy tale reworking is full of beans, smartly written and packs plenty of fun."
rotten, A missed opportunity.
rotten, Me Him Her has an admirably buoyant energy but a murky message and shortage of laughs.
rotten, What a disappointment!
fresh, This is a film to share with a friend or loved one; you'll have plenty to discuss and laugh about afterward.
fresh, One of those rare films that makes you sit up and take notice of something you didn't even realise you cared so much about.
rotten, Thinker and writer adds an intellectual footnote to the Holocaust
fresh, This endearing escapist summer adventure will bring tears to your eyes and is not to be missed. The design work is spectacular and the cinematography is vivid utilizing every color imaginable in the crayon box. The sight gags and jokes make this a...
fresh, There's something undeniably charming about such an amateurish attempt to establish a world record.
rotten," Mehta fudges the political allegory in favour of the story's magical realism, but still can't get her arms around the material - or past Rushdie's own bear-hug."
fresh," This is still the most frightening film you will ever see: unforgettably sadistic, utterly plausible, and totally f---ing terrifying."
fresh," Set in 1981, a canny and absorbing drama paints a highly convincing portrait of Barack Obama when he was a 20-year-old college student in New York, still piecing together who he was."
fresh," The fun of a mystery is solving the crime based on the clues presented, but the clues don't necessarily lead to the conclusion. It feels like we're just stumbling over the final reveal. Despite these complaints, Crooked House is worth watching. "
rotten, Writer-director Susan Walter's film seems almost determined to disprove the causality of social phenomena.
rotten, A minor curiosity.
rotten," The problem is that all of this is just one high concept application that doesn't really do much or go anywhere with the material once the novelty has worn off. (Full Content Review for Parents - Sex, Violence, Profanity, etc. - Also Available)"
fresh," ...a strange, disjointed, and occasionally beautiful biopic about the controversial social psychologist Stanley Milgram."
rotten, The glacial pace is only quickened for seconds at a time with evocative ideas.
rotten," It's not a TV remake, with pooches playing the parts made famous by James Brolin, Anne Baxter, and Connie Sellecca. Damn."
rotten," I've been on ""Sesame Street."" I know Elmo. Cookie Monster is a friend of mine. ""Happytime Murders,"" you're no ""Sesame Street"" . . . and you're not ""Avenue Q"" either."
rotten, Viewers who watch with a curious mind rather than a hushed awe for His Goreness might have a few questions.
fresh," An emotional and well-acted film, which ends up giving a valuable message about child abuse in India, showing us real images of Saroo and his family. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh, A muscularly directed dramatic thriller about the difficulties of starting over and the inevitability of violence.
fresh," ""Patti Cake$"" winds up being a celebration of art, enterprise and self-invention that's as tough as it is touching. At the risk of mixing metaphors, not to mention musical genres, it rocks."
rotten, ...sweet-as-Splenda Garry Marshall pipedream...
fresh, More magical than Narnia and more fun than Iron Man.
rotten, For a movie about surprises ... there really aren't many.
rotten, The pupils' failure to question their fate plays more like lethargy than tragically repressed emotion.
fresh," Not the easiest film of the year, but certainly among the best."
fresh," The satirical bite dissipates a little as the story drags on, though a powerful, emotional coda makes it worth the wait."
fresh," It's largely concert footage, so familiarity with the songs goes a long way. The thing is, I found I had most of them lodged in my head somewhere, waiting to be remembered. "
rotten, Faris is endearing even at those times when this frantic I've-slept-with- 19-guys comedy is barely endurable.
rotten, 3...2...1...Letdown!
rotten," What would have made an entertaining, if experimental, 20-minute short film has here been extended beyond sanity."
rotten, Chéri really doesn't work because its central love story lacks dramatic force or even enough fun scenes to keep us going.
fresh, Feminist? Absolutely. Detrimental to the film? Not in the slightest...it's a movie of heavy metal imagination and bone-grinding engineering. Motorheads rejoice!
rotten, What once was a chilling spectacle of a series has become an unimaginative and tedious mess.
fresh," Much of this may sound familiar, but The Borderlands' crafty virtue is that it understands that hand-held camerawork and boo scares aren't an excuse to neglect plot, dialogue or characters."
rotten," A sickening, socially-irresponsible glorification of depraved and sadistic behavior...The worst film of 2005."
fresh," That best kind of B-movie; one that will have you alternately laughing, squirming in your seat and yelling at the screen."
fresh," It has a haunting, desolate beauty, and it's achingly sad, like a half deserted zoo in the middle of a Midwestern winter."
fresh," Behind the snow games and lovable Siberian huskies (plus one sheep dog), the picture hosts a parka-wrapped dose of heart."
fresh, a workmanlike shocker that immediately announces the course it's going to follow and proceeds directly down that road with no detours or sidetrips
fresh," The real-life stunts are eminently suspenseful and exhilarating, and adrenaline junkies will be well pleased. For the uninitiated, however, Strauch's adoring treatment of the Boenishes may be a little hard to stomach."
fresh," It is the most extraordinary feat this film, and it's not just an exercise in pyrotechnics, it's an exploration of existential angst."
fresh," [Rooney] Mara, always a very contained actor, emphasises the edgily unpredictable in Una."
fresh, The most convincing of the three features Joe Swanberg has made with star and co-writer Jake Johnson (each of which has represented a highlight in his filmography) ...
fresh, An interesting if rather unfocused documentary by Laura Poitras.
rotten," Of course Lurie overwrites it, transforming forces of inexplicable violence into idiot individuals with paper-thin M.O.'s."
fresh," Viewed through the lens of Italian exploitation films, Bone Tomahawk starts to make sense."
rotten, I Give It a Year deserves a much harsher sentence than the title suggests and without remission for good conduct.
fresh," You either sink or swim. By osmosis, you'll become an active player, forced to keep the spider web plot in your head. Don't count on any bathroom breaks. "
fresh," an emotional thriller, a soufflé of a farce, and a profound consideration of the fathomless yearnings of the human heart "
fresh," Have the movies ever talked this quickly, before or since?"
fresh," In Dealt, director Luke Koren masterfully tells the story of a man, who through hard work and discipline overcame his disability. "
fresh," It's very, very good -- in its best scenes, exhilarating."
fresh," Genius is more satisfying than many recent traditional biopics, and, oddly, by embracing caricature-like portrayals, the film is able to tap into its simple but humble pleasures."
rotten, Whilst not truly awful it just didn't work well on any level for me and it missed most of its marks.
rotten," It's hard to make the case that any of this means anything, or is even supposed to ..."
fresh, The film's multilayered narrative (which employs a flashback within a flashback) and complementary use of organic transitions is nothing if not breathtaking.
fresh, It's a credit to the chemistry and charisma of Key and Peele that the movie works at all.
fresh," A thoroughly enjoyable wheeze, bobbing along to a jaunty score (cue Jools Holland cameo) and blessed with moments of knowing wit."
fresh," Theron's performance is a success, but it has the unfortunate side effect of overshadowing the rest of the movie."
fresh, Martyrs has an intelligence and a dogged determination to do and to say what its predecessors could or would not.
fresh," It's a role capitalizing on Riseborough's desire to disappear inside whoever she's playing. For her, no two parts are alike, allowing her to always be fresh, always be different and always be sensational. "
fresh," It is in the scenes between Isaac and the protean Ben Kingsley, adding another memorable performance to his filmography as Eichmann, where the film's dilemma plays out. "
rotten," The puzzle pieces are all there. But when you put them all together, the result is a bit of a gyp -- neat but utterly forgettable."
fresh," Considering it took off from an entertaining place, this is one sequel that flies rings around the original offering."
rotten," Remember what a fun couple Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves were in Speed? Well, forget that."
fresh, Its two nonprofessional child actors ably reflect the terror of the times.
rotten, Perky turns from supporting thesps can't compensate for the sense that this plays like an attenuated TV episode.
rotten," Charlie's Country has a lived-in lead performance, complimented by clean photography, but does the film's love for its central character diminish its ideological objectivity? "
rotten," Anna Faris can be cute and funny in the bubbly, ditzy, Goldie Hawn manner - as she proved in The House Bunny - but she's mostly shrill and irritating in lame chick flick What's Your Number"
fresh," One of the most moving scenes in the film is close to the end when we see the survivors in a series of long, silent close-ups, as they are now... jowls, grey hair and aging itself becomes a triumph, as it rarely is on American movie screens. "
rotten," A slick, mostly engaging drama."
fresh, A film that deserves to be seen by anyone who cares about cinema.
rotten," A rowdy salute to the thankless sacrifices made by modern mothers, ""Bad Moms"" has lots of spirit and wonderful chemistry from its three leads. And yet, this so-so comedy can't shake a formulaic, uninspired construction."
rotten," Unnervingly smooth, mouths moving in strange, even frightening formations, the Polar people are the least convincing things on-screen, glaring impostors amid the otherwise painstakingly rendered scenery."
rotten," A duly serious and ambitious fall movie that, despite the best efforts of its formidable director and cast, can't remotely match the excitement of real life."
rotten," Was there a crying need for a film version of Entourage? Hardly. But the movie is still a tribute to Piven's iconic performance as Ari Gold, a devil you can love. "
rotten," ""Nation"" has some sensational visual ideas and a few strong performances, but it's also a tired ""Braveheart"" retread with nothing new to say about the Black Experience, often recycling brutality found in better features."
rotten," Graced with an appealing soundtrack and actors who put fierce heart into every gesture, the movie never achieves the emotional impact desired."
rotten," When torture porn becomes as snooze-inducing as lecture hall, it's time to call it a day."
rotten," The story's accidental timeliness may generate some interest, but the film kills it pretty swiftly."
fresh, Diamantino gleefully reflects back this surreal moment when the world is simultaneously becoming more closed off and more open.
rotten," Subtlety is knocked on its ass and put out for the count, though a chilling sense of white self-entitlement and ethical superiority tingles on."
rotten," Do Sloane and Darabont really think they can drop the complex blacklist agony into this vat of mush, and say something real?"
rotten, A fairy-tale that's fractured in ways that seem perversely calculated to alienate us even as it tries to draw us in...a cinematic pratfall.
rotten," It's hard to believe this shoddy, dishonest mess is Clark's sixth feature film."
rotten," Kinetic thriller about hypnosis is irritatingly befuddling, not mesmerising"
fresh, It's the best new battle film since Black Hawk Down.
fresh," It's an unsentimental - even strangely violent - and affecting movie that speaks to the current siege on reading, literacy and independent bookshops everywhere."
rotten," As the double-crosses come thick and fast, it's hard to retain much curiosity about or sympathy for any of the film's duplicitous protagonists."
fresh," War is manufactured fun but sombre for a moment in this lively, animated remake of La guerre des tuques (The Dog Who Stopped the War), a beloved French-Canadian film from 1984."
rotten," It's too cartoonish and cosy by half, a sort of Punch-and-Judy-show rendition of a fascinating man's professional crisis."
fresh," A psychological horror that is sure to scar anyone who has a fear of hospitals, old people, needles, snakes, water...."
fresh," There is something a bit thin about the story, and just as in 28 Days Later, I find that digital, rage-filled zombies halve in dramatic interest with every second that passes."
rotten, One of the ugliest movies I've ever seen.
fresh," Each actor inhabits their role with a precision and mettle that means even in the depths of confusion, the complex group dynamics are easy to read."
rotten, Parents will have to be end-of-holidays desperate to take their little darlings to this punishingly uninspired animation.
fresh, Count on Count putting a smile on your face.
rotten," One wonders if there is a darker, grittier script for Cowboys & Aliens on Jon Favreau's night stand, dog-eared and tear-stained over what might have been. "
rotten, All the stunning visuals in the world can't raise Chronicles above the level of a ridiculous Rambo-in-space flick.
fresh," Let me confess that as ridiculously manipulative and sentimental a family movie as A Dog's Purpose is, I'm a bit of a sucker for movies like it."
rotten, The big-screen Get Smart aspires to being an action movie. Big mistake. But raising Maxwell Smart's IQ? And transforming him into a post-20th century sensitive guy? Even bigger mistakes.
rotten," The script by Scott Rosenberg (Con Air) starts out stringing together underworld cliches and, about midpoint when it becomes obvious nothing is working, turns on itself in a desperate attempt at self-parody."
rotten," With the shootings and bombings going off incessantly for the movie's almost 21/2-hour run, it feels like the film-maker is gleefully navigating a military video game and all the film's characters are mere pawns."
rotten," Thankfully, a cast of solid U.K. actors pick up the slack, bringing intensity and behavioral nuance to an otherwise airy actioner that feels severely pared down from its original intent. "
rotten, It's not clear if this is a thriller or a melodrama. [Full Review in Spanish] 
rotten," Less a sequel than a remake, The Hangover Part II brings the wedding smashers to Bangkok with more outrageousness but diminishing returns. Still, initial grosses will be explosive."
rotten," When the end-credit bloopers roll, Sudeikis and Aniston, free of the contrived plot, look like they're finally having fun."
fresh," Clever, entertaining, and very, very dark, World's Greatest Dad is unlike any comedy that you've seen this year and, for that fact alone, deserves some attention."
rotten," There's a word for the strenuous, shameless plucking of an audience's emotions that this movie traffics in: cornography."
rotten," There are maybe two scenes in the movie where I didn't think all of Burns' lesser qualities were in evidence, and as a character that appears in almost every scene to only have two where I didn't dislike him heavily, that's a bad thing."
fresh," The film is impressively mounted and Schaefer has made a directorial debut of distinction, but it is an uncomfortable ride from the opening scenes of Chapman arriving in New York to the inevitable, inexorable final scene."
rotten," This movie's gotta be the result of some pot-induced wager between Adam Sandler and his nattering cronies: ""Hey guys, I'm like a $20 million movie star! How freakin' FUNNY is that? I bet I can make ANY movie I want!"""
rotten," One wants to say ""too soon,"" but 150 years would be too soon for Oliver Hirschbiegel's close-to-comedic treatment of the princess' last chance at happiness."
fresh, Wakefield feels like it is a modern day version of Rear Window but without all the thrills...in this character study that stars Breaking Bad's Bryan Cranston.
fresh, An incredibly moving and masterfully controlled experience.
fresh," A dark, brilliant journey into memory and schizophrenia whose peeled-back layers reveal an unexpected heroism."
rotten," Without fail, every time I found myself liking this movie, it would break the spell with its ulterior motives."
fresh," The multi-hyphenate and her partner Jen Tullock craft the kind of indie offering that doesn't always work anymore, but this strange family comedy is an amusing exception."
rotten," When people gripe about Hollywood's reliance on sequels and cheap franchise cash-ins, this is the kind of movie they mean: no Grimm's Fairy Tale, but a grim tale nonetheless."
fresh," ""This does lack a little soul, but it hardly matters, as the full-throttle, über-monstrous fun more than makes up for it."""
fresh, Good effects and themes overcome a glaring plot hole. 
fresh," There's added appeal thanks to Barthes' silly but fun film via the outstanding cinematography by her collaborator, Andrij Parekh, whose arty lighting and careful framing make the film a visual treat."
rotten," Bee Movie is certainly not low-budget, but it has all the staying power and creative value of a B-movie. The secret life of bees, as told by Seinfeld, is a bore with a capital B."
rotten," The commandeered plot is like the film's train. When you first get on board it just sits on the track. Once the story begins moving, you can predict each stop along the route."
fresh," Marlina the Murderer in Four Acts is a brilliant female-driven arthouse/grindhouse rape-revenge Western that manages to endear, repulse, emotionally stir, mesmerize and propel in the best of ways."
rotten," Everything about 'Gone' has the plasticy, leatherette feel of an imitation thriller."
rotten," A junior version of Underworld, minus the vampires, the action scenes, the cool FX, and the half-a-brain."
rotten, A fascinating historical footnote becomes an excuse to throw lots of money at the screen in Kang Je-kyu's My Way.
fresh, A rattling scare show with a brain. Defies expectations by shattering conventions of the classic horror-anthology style.
rotten, What's the point of knowing what there is to know about a fellow when we get only sound bites of what he has done with his enormous talent?
rotten, Like watching your whole life crawl towards you on its hands and knees.
rotten," After two-and-a-half hours of world-threatening chaos and world-saving derring-do, you leave the theater satisfied, but without so much as a single memorable image (or idea) lingering in your mind."
fresh," Director Liza Johnson, working from a script by Joey Sagal, Hanala Sagal and Cary Elwes, deftly captures the historical context of the bizarre meeting for both sides."
fresh, A treat for kids and adults alike.
rotten, A last-minute flurry of action and a final plot twist aren't enough to redeem this busy but tedious thriller.
fresh, An honestly extraordinary maturation performance by Even Stevens' Shia LaBeouf proves Disney truly has monopoly over the most talented youth actors
fresh," The ride can be a bit bumpy, but The Lincoln Lawyer gets you where you're going."
fresh," It also shows that while tradition can devolve into a conformity that stifles compassion and love, acting in mere self-interest can ultimately be just as destructive."
rotten," It's a dumb idea on its surface, and as we get deeper and deeper into the concept, at no point does the screenplay ... make us believe it is anything more than that."
fresh," For the most part, Planes: Fire & Rescue is more about chuckles than big guffaws, coupled with thrilling 3-D flight and firefighting action scenes and lessons about friendship, respect and loyalty."
rotten, Kingdom of Heaven makes Alexander look like Ben-Hur... It's just CNN with CGI.
fresh," There are, of course, two ways to experience Inherent Vice: with the brain on or the brain off. Both work. The latter is a good time, the former more illuminating."
rotten," None of this really adds up to much beyond an hour-and-a-half or so of vague doubletalk, arbitrary decisions and increasingly annoying frustration."
fresh," Superhero cinema has lectured us, ad infinitum, on the responsibility that is conferred by extraordinary gifts. Praise be to Larson, for reminding us that they can be bringers of fun."
fresh, It is brutally epic.
fresh," With One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Forman takes his rightful place as one of our most creative young directors. His casting is inspired, his sense of milieu is assured, and he could probably wring Academy Award performances from a stone."
fresh, One of the inventive films of the new teen wave!
fresh," Not only the best movie I've seen this year, but also my favorite. Definitely go see this!"
fresh," Popcorny-good, but with a lot of unpopped kernels and unfortunate gobs of Golden Topping(TM) lurking at the bottom."
fresh, The hardboiled appetites of The Postman Always Rings Twice brushing against European anguish
rotten," It avoids Hallmark greeting-card slickness and Cecil B. DeMille razzmatazz, but replaces them with a plodding earnestness that leaves it largely inoffensive but rather dull."
rotten," The movie-dutifully shot in shades of old-timey sepia-does get better as its staginess falls away, but far too much drama stays on the page."
fresh," It's a well-meaning, often superbly acted film with nothing very original to say."
fresh," Peake does a wonderful job conveying her character's essential young-at-heartness despite a heavy load of responsibilities and grief, and Forte shines as the tentative Ted learning to step off of life's sidelines."
fresh, By focusing on the super and not the man Man of Steel doesn't deliver Superman.
rotten," Despite the novel premise and the strong acting - yes, strong acting in a Schwarzenegger movie - ""Maggie"" simply doesn't take root. That's sad to admit, because it's the kind of film one wished were better."
rotten," Rugrats Go Wild boasts tiresome plotlessness, TV-grade animation, and doesn't even propagandize the kids with hearty moral messages"
rotten," Sapochnik is completely unable to create suspension of disbelief, at least with the preposterous plot he had to work with. "
fresh, It's pretty obvious who is going to triumph from the outset and this drains a degree of tension from the judge's deliberations.
fresh, World's Greatest Dad makes sharp but obvious observations about the social strata of an American high school.
rotten," Most gags are as disposable as last week's colored eggs, but there's likable geniality that keeps Hop tolerable, hinging on your tolerance of Brand's cheeky style."
fresh," A comedy that is entertaining thanks to its interpreters, but it ends up being more effective in its social analysis between white aristocracy and the new rich. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten," What we have is a movie that's too classy to exploit its slob-vs.-snob premise, and too dry to allow a little anarchic joy to the mix."
fresh," Ultimately, it's this streak of realism that prevents Sex And The City from becoming just another fluffy New York fairytale."
fresh," Writer/director Dean DeBlois's second of a planned trilogy based on Cressida Cowell's children's books has a daring, shocking climax and its underlying theme could be read as championing the maligned pit bull breed..."
rotten," A long and didactic history lesson, the repetitive Lord of War is like a Michael Moore message movie."
rotten," Bird Box would have functioned as far more intense and less formulaic to the apocalyptic genre by pushing the five-years-into-the-pandemic aspect, which forces the filmmakers to creatively play around with the plague that they have unleashed"
rotten," The film weakly trades reliable popcorn action for a story about blossoming young love, puzzling fatherly heroics and overwrought messages on the dangers of global warming."
rotten," Has a cliché around every turn, but it takes forever to make the turns, lumbering along like an old nag."
rotten, Isn't slavery funny? Ugh!
rotten," Do we need yet another film about drug dealers? No, especially not one that takes 157 minutes to get where it's going."
rotten, Villeneuve's indulgence in mood and melancholy mount to a conclusion that wastes its compelling premise and wallows in infuriatingly all-consuming sentimentality.
rotten," This production, these situations and characters, are to Shakespeare what advertising is to truth."
fresh," Unfinished Song is shameless hokum, but it should please its target audience."
rotten, An execrable mess and a gobsmacking horror show in all the wrong ways.
rotten," The harder Dano tries to make the movie feel cinematic (and boy, does he!), the more stagy it feels."
fresh," There's a proper debate to be had about the validation of torture in so many films. 'We used to outsource torture,' ex-CIA spy Bryan (Liam Neeson) says, 'but it was unreliable.'"
fresh," A colourful, delightfully raucous cacophony of riotous belly laughs and epic set-pieces, cementing itself as one of most outrageous entries in the series so far. "
fresh," The story's simple, the quest not that complicated. But the joy of Shrek is in the telling, in the details along the way."
rotten," It's talky, clumsy and a bit trivial, but the talk is rarely dull, and there's an integrity about its clumsiness: It's harder to be smooth when you have things you really want to say."
rotten," Don't let the indulgent chatter fool you. Here, Perry has nothing to say that's worth listening to."
rotten," It's a long slog, not because what the film says is provocative but because the technique is as slack as the writing."
fresh," Father James' stature grows in our eyes, due in great part to Gleeson's powerful performance, which at the very least deserves an Oscar nomination if not the award itself. "
rotten," A film that's so bad, so grievously awful in so many ways, that you're convinced that it was meant to be a comedy."
rotten," Much to admire here, but not Isaacs' finest hour."
fresh," Invictus remains inspiring and educational, especially during this present time in America in which we are supposedly muddling our way into a post-racial society."
fresh," Jeremy Renner is a force of nature in this taut, thrilling and completely devastating true tale. Kill the Messenger will enthrall you, horrify you and, most importantly, it will light your fire."
fresh," If you're an opera fan and are familiar with Turandot, then you probably should check this one out. If you'd rather be drawn and quartered than even walk past a building where an opera once took place, you probably should sit this one out."
fresh, A valentine to the life of the theater..the kind of movie that allows you to see other people's passion at work.
rotten, 27 Dresses makes the point that modern American weddings are all pretty much alike. The same could be said about modern American romantic comedies.
fresh," Enjoyable, time-killing piece of throwaway Friday-night pap... It's broad, stupid fun that, against all odds, ends up coagulating into an actual story with a point. "
fresh, ... a good-size barrel of fun.
rotten, It's hard to decipher whether these particular details signpost a dream logic or a screenwriter who doesn't get out much.
rotten," It's obvious how this British romantic comedy will turn out, and getting there isn't funny or charming enough to generate much emotional investment."
rotten, Sets the proceedings within a misty cloud of conjecture. 
fresh, A classic case of good old-fashioned American optimism.
fresh," It's ripcord filmmaking, with paint-by-numbers emotionalism. While [Ratner's] preoccupation with surface thrill still makes for a generally pleasing comic book movie, it shortchanges the depth we've come to expect from the X-Men franchise."
fresh," 158 minutes represents a heavy investment in time and popcorn. But the unrelenting pace, almighty effects and sheer tongue-in-cheekiness make it more than worth your while."
rotten," Even without two other versions, this 'Chambermaid,' good as it sometimes looks, would be struggling for air; with them, it is all but pointless except to Lea Seydoux completists, and fans of the daintily perched hat. "
rotten," Thusly, I don't care about her, could care less if Sayuri finally finds true love. That means I don't like the movie, and if I ever write my own memoirs about my life reviewing film I'll make sure and say it again."
rotten, The screwiness feels patterned and arbitrary. There's little Upside here.
rotten," Rest assured that, by the end, a little pixie dust will solve everything."
fresh, ...give[s] you some sense of what it must have been like a literary/journalistic star in the 1960s. 
fresh," It has a lovable, genuine, and disarming ""let's all put on a show"" ethos that's refreshingly upfront and honest about its wacky concept and cultural touchstones."
fresh," For anyone with an interest in dance, ""Pina"" is a must-see. For anyone not interested in contemporary dance, ""Pina"" is a should-see. It could change your mind."
rotten," Just another step toward the Disneyfication of our collective memories... a studio-manufactured tearjerker, with nothing left to chance."
fresh, When Doctor Strange works it does so beautifully.
fresh, Foxtrot excels at showing the tedium and dehumanizing effects of military deployment.
rotten, Might best be enjoyed as a daytime soaper.
rotten, A supremely annoying film.
fresh," Butler and Schreiber deliver commanding performances. They are men who could explode at any moment, at work or at home. That nonstop ticking beneath their calm exteriors fills the film with a gripping tension."
rotten, Dares to challenge film industry standards but fails because of its narrative and technical deficiencies. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh, There's a method here more polished than in any of Nolan's previous work.
rotten, Director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo hurns out a straightforward cinematic gorefest that's competent and repulsive but not much else.
rotten," A cumbersome and trite ""dangerous rise of technology"" story that fails to engage."
rotten, A strong cast can't rescue the repetitively crude and recklessly derivative material. Mike and Dave need a lot more help than in merely finding wedding dates.
fresh," 99 Homes brings an unbearable subject, excruciatingly close; Bahrani makes you feel powerless to the machinations of the greedy, perhaps that's the point. "
rotten," The cast are all non-actors, and boy, does it show."
rotten," In a crowded landscape full of pine-tree scented TV options, Grumpy Cat's Worst Christmas Ever needs to be much better or much worse than it is."
fresh," It is with his infectious brand of amusement that Pahani explores this girl's strange world which, through generations of tradition, remains curiously divorced from his and Behnaz Jafari's."
rotten," It's not the worst film you'll see all year, but it's not going to wind up on anyone's honour roll, either."
rotten, In any other inkwell [it] would be a striking experiment; within the filmography of Woody Allen is too similar to his other films. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten, Funny like its subject but not nearly as daring.
fresh," Predictable, but effective adrenaline cocktail. The premise has been seen on an endless number of times, but is still capable of fully entertain. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten, a flick as deadly to the concept of entertainment as the deadly sin of the same name is to one's mortal soul
rotten, A lazily written and generically directed Fatal Attraction knockoff.
fresh," The comedy itself is hit or miss -- mostly hit for me, but humor is incredibly subjective, and this style of humor is particularly prone to the 'either you like it or you don't' effect."
rotten," Flimsy and foreboding, it's a female-centric crime thriller..."
rotten, Would love to have Seth Rogen as a neighbor. He'd be a blast and probably more fun than his movies.
fresh, Still terrific entertainment
fresh," Rooted in richly played, likeable characters, this modest set-up percolates with smart, urbane humour, with Jaoui still finding time for some broad set-piece chuckles."
fresh, Campion hits the same thematic ground with the same passionate release as she did in The Piano (1993) and the underrated Holy Smoke (1999).
rotten," Unfortunately, bees just aren't that funny."
rotten, Turning the sociopathic cynicism up to eleven tends to be ineffective unless wit and insight are included in the mix.
rotten," Hosking's offerings wear thin, relentlessly attempting to sicken us with cartoon violence, excessive nudity and crass language."
rotten, A distressingly lifeless concoction.
rotten," Reeves does an excellent job of being a stoic servant bound by honour to reject love and embrace death. And ""stoic servant"" sounds a little like an actor stuck trying to make the best of a big budget film collapsing all around him, if you think about it. "
rotten," ""Arm"" Just the Same Old Game."
fresh," Thanks to the current administration, Hollywood now has mroe villains than in the Cold War era."
fresh," Sicko, the professional provocateur's most accomplished and fervent film, is what the movie doc prescribes for temporary relief from the chronic headache that is the American health-care system."
rotten, A fantasy that has little to do with the way things actually happened in Iraq and even less to do with the way a soldier on active duty could ever behave.
fresh," For the most part, it works and is engaging enough to keep most viewers interested to see how things play out. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Sexual Content, Nudity, Profanity, etc. - also Available)"
fresh," A devilishly, hysterically, cacklingly, subversively funny picture that builds and builds until it literally self-destructs."
fresh," ""...tells this story smartly and expertly, but what makes it a masterpiece is... it's fun too."""
rotten," Understanding the importance of strong, principled journalists should be a cause for celebration. Yet here, the media is depicted as a force, hell-bent on destruction. "
fresh," Two score and two years later, it deserves just as large an audience. Gather the family - and enjoy."
rotten," Jackson does some good work, sporting a high gasp of a voice and letting his character surface to reality smoothly, but the movie becomes too much of a morality play as it unwinds."
rotten," Though it seems appropriate to make ""Sleeping Beauty"" as empty, enervating and dull as its main character, it only serves to underscore the lack of entertainment or insight."
fresh," Director Sam Raimi returns to his Evil Dead roots for this tongue-in-cheek gorefest -- one part spooky chiller, one part campy chuckler."
rotten," But for a movie that wants to tell you this unbelievable story about a smart guy, ""The Catcher Was a Spy"" shows its hand with faux-intellectualism. "
fresh, Among the most formally accomplished of new Iranian films.
fresh," I really liked this. The third act is a little wonky...but it's also an hour-and-a-half, very tight, and something new."
fresh," [Sheila Hancock] delivers a nuanced and poignant performance as a woman determined to achieve her goal, yet still doubting her ability to carry it out (and equally impressively Hancock did all her own ""stunts"")."
fresh," Ridiculous? Yep. Fun? Absolutely. If there's such a thing as a classy B-movie, then this is it."
fresh," Giving a seriously Marlene-Dietrich-like performance in her first major role, Ni Ni is spellbinding as the hooker with a heart of gold."
rotten," Wake me when urban films stop using ""get back at whitey"" as a comedic device."
fresh," It's not as dynamic as the bond between siblings, but it does offer a gothic-fantasy love element that will keep tween girls engaged."
fresh," The Last Jedi boasts many very good performances, ones that enrich the characters and which salute writer/director Johnson's ability to find the humanity within technology, something he proved early on with his artful time-travel thriller Looper."
rotten," The Dilemma is built upon an inherently false premise. In its heart it knows this, so it expends all sorts of energy trying to throw sand in the eyes of viewers, obscuring this fact for the sake of 'zaniness.'"
fresh, A solid movie about a remarkable true story.
rotten, The movie is too long. Too much story contains too little humanity or drama. Too many things happen far too often for the really big things to register with an audience when they're filing out of the theater.
rotten, I found it tediously manipulative despite its Herculean energy.
fresh, Matt Damon saves the show with a perfectly unhinged portrait of the main character.
rotten, Generic fright-fest that ups the number of young people getting munched without recapturing the level of suspenseful tension that made the original stand out in the crowded field of similarly themed flicks.
fresh, The film claims that the true power of Peter Parker are his naive youth and sense of humor. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten," Life of Crime is like an errant golf putt that appears headed for the hole, but just keeps rolling and rolling, all the way off the green. In other words, just missed . . . by a mile."
rotten," With thinly drawn characters, uneven performances and tin-eared dialogue, ""Stonewall'' plays at best like a musical without the songs."
fresh," Coogan's comic timing has never been better, and Meaney is perfectly cast as his friend/foil. The film hums along at a brisk pace, piling one witty absurdity on top of another."
rotten," Out Cold is like the Caddyshack of snowboarding, just with a fraction of the laughs."
rotten," Presumably, to understand Pasolini is to excavate him from the twisted miasma Ferrara has created in his image."
fresh," Its lava-lamp visuals are consistently intoxicating, blurring the boundaries between physical spaces in ways that feel fitting to the scenario. "
rotten," There isn't much more to say. My gut tells me kids under the age of ten are going to like it, everyone else going to want to be spending their time and money elsewhere."
rotten," It is no worse than the average of the genre, but it is one of the most unremarkable, garden-variety installments I've seen."
rotten," Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a pretty bad movie, but it isn't because of the reasons you will see on message boards or comment sections."
rotten," Packed with gags - some clever, many lame and almost all puerile - the film has too many dead spots between the laughs, and I caught myself checking my watch almost as often as I chuckled."
fresh, Rarely has a kid's-eye view of the adult world been captured with such innocence and insight.
rotten," Too light, too silly."
fresh, Gifted isn't the best or most sophisticated or most original film of the year so far - but it just might be my favorite.
rotten," More bang bang in bed and clubbing for babes, than shooting that crucial African historical moment. So are the Bang Bang boys critical witnesses to found history, or tools exploited by the white security forces to give Mandela a bad rap? Who knows. "
fresh," Black Panther perfects what the Marvel Cinematic Universe has always done so well: build a world so richly rendered, it's almost a letdown to reach the end of the film and realize it's time to return to our own reality."
fresh," The island's gorgeous to look at, but that beauty hides a darker side - and that's just as true for The Red Turtle."
rotten," Particularly unsurprising, premised on trendy body-fluids raunch (farting, vomiting, ejaculating) and the perennially popular idea that high school sucks."
fresh," Technically, the best Hitchcock ever...and one of the most nail-biting."
rotten," Allen seems to be aiming for the precise intersection of art and commerce where sophistication is implied, but nothing that takes place is ever obscure or challenging or revelatory. "
rotten, There's just one problem: The story.
rotten," A regression in the usual strong work from Marvel Studios, Iron Man 3 suffers from director Shane Black's mishandling of this popular superhero character. "
fresh," Manages an impressive balancing act in term of its tricky, quicksilver tone, which constantly oscillates between foreboding, menacing, hilarity and absurdity without ever feeling incongruous."
rotten," Kutcher and Heigl have such forced chemistry that it's hard to believe they'd ever fall in love, much less stay married in blissful blah-dom. "
fresh," A spunky, impassioned and resourceful doc on the cutthroat world of US college basketball made for a pittance by Adam Yauch."
fresh," Inception is a grown-up thriller ride through the dreamscapes of the mind, with Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead. The movie is a sign that Hollywood retains some intellectual oomph."
fresh," Every frame of it seems delighted by people, delighted by cities, by neighborhoods, delighted by life life itself. It's warm and attentive."
fresh, Juno is a real treat and maybe the most unexpected great movie in years.
rotten, Avoid this film. It will eat your soul and vomit black bile in your face.
rotten, I would suggest that Original Films change their name to Deja Vu Productions. 
rotten," The problem is that the plot is simplistic, the jokes aren't very funny, and if you're not a Lego aficionado you may be wondering what the fuss is all about."
rotten," As deliberately provocative and in-your-face ugly as this film is, it still plays as second-rate Tarantino instead of first-rate Lumet."
rotten," If heaven is a big ball of cotton candy, then Just Like Heaven lives up to its name. It has no nutritional value, and it won't fill you up, but it's bright, pink and fluffy."
rotten," Snatched opens strongly as it details Emily's comically pathetic life, but she soon becomes more annoying than amusing, and director Jonathan Levine's odd pacing causes the scenes to alternate between high comic energy and obvious padding."
rotten," This is the one time the garam masalas needed some ""masala"" filmmaking. By the time some of it appears towards the end - that of the airport-running scene variety - there is reluctance to its sterility."
rotten," [Aims] for the easiest and most rudimentary situations and dialogue, insulting even the slowest of audience members."
rotten," With a running time of more than two hours, this sprawling, would-be epic needed to deliver far more."
fresh," This flawed, lovely, odd film both displeases and delights."
fresh," While this is an extremely unlikely and farfetched scenario, I'll be damned if it doesn't work. "
fresh, West and lenser Eliot Rockett deserve considerable credit for being able to generate suspense and occasionally spring scares without relying on familiar haunted-house atmospherics.
rotten, Singer is so hung up on the intricacies of his plot that he never allows the world he's portraying to cut loose into atmospheric fantasy.
rotten, Ed Wood Jr.'s debacles were at least humorous.
fresh, ...Proyas has crafted a vision distinctly his own.
rotten, The nervous energy musical works too hard to sustain a magic it never achieves onscreen.
fresh, Klapisch's movie boasts passages of genuine magic.
fresh, You'll never root for the bad guys more than you will here.
rotten," This is a very well-intentioned film and director Ron Howard does the best he can with it, but it is too long, too slow and too dumb."
rotten," Olsen's performance is a worthy draw, yet even despite her best efforts, Silent House remains an intangible folly, caught between atmospheric chiller and inconsequential farce."
rotten," Poirier wants to revel in the gutter, but despite the juvenile vulgarity of Tomcats, his head is in the clouds."
rotten," If a filmmaker attempted to combine everything casual moviegoers don't like about superhero franchises, they couldn't come up with a picture as execrable as this one."
fresh," Hawke and Delpy remain as charming as ever, and their combined goofiness is more endearing than annoying."
rotten, Daniel Day-Lewis' miscasting throws the entire movie off kilter and one is left to contemplate the holes in the material.
rotten," Mulholland Drive is...either for people much smarter than me who can figure it all out, or for people easily amused by striking imagery and oddball characters."
fresh," Swanberg doesn't exactly reinvent the romantic-comedy formula, but he explores it in unexpected ways, with a terrific cast making the relationships all the more genuine and enjoyable."
fresh, [T]his may be the best straight-up horror movie of the year -- I was riveted by the sinister sophistication of it.
rotten," After a promisingly crass start, the film runs out of ideas and after some T&A material and violent slapstick, winds up in a mood of plumply sentimental solemnity."
rotten, Disappointing robots vs monsters blockbuster that features spectacular special effects but is let down by poor acting and a painfully dull script.
fresh, A truly subversive piece of work.
rotten, Singularly fails to dramatise the genocide at the story's core with the cinematic force it deserves.
fresh," A clever, playful and, yes, poetic accounting of the literary icon's run for his life from his home country of Chile."
rotten," A quintessential paycheck movie, made not because someone had a terrific vision for how to adapt the story but because a studio owned the rights and thought they could make some cash from it."
rotten," The Predator is filled with visual and verbal callbacks to McTiernan's movie, but there's no Schwarzenegger and no subtext, and the movie suffers from the lack of both. "
fresh," Unlike its namesake city, Gurgaon isn't messy enough and doesn't leave you gasping for air. But it provides a temporary taste of the dark side."
rotten," Saw 3D is the seventh Saw I've seen, and maybe the sickest-which is exactly what I said about Saw VI."
rotten, The dialogue is so painfully naive that it seems to have been written by a 15-year-old who has read nothing but Alistair MacLean novels.
fresh," Sweet Sixteen is a wonderfully bittersweet effort, and one of Loach's best works."
rotten, Kevin Smith gets his weird on
rotten, Here is a movie that seems at war with the notion that animation can inspire or invigorate.
rotten," I felt uninvolved, finding myself drifting into my own dreamworld instead of the filmmaker's."
fresh," The onetime Fresh Prince surpasses himself in Michael Mann's Ali, physically, vocally and emotionally meeting the challenge of this biopic of the charismatic athlete."
fresh, It's a stunt film that only just overcomes the challenge it's set itself.
rotten, There is almost literally no difference between watching Babies and just watching a baby.
rotten," The blunt eroticism is going backwards, always structurally and narratively backwards, as in all films of Noé. [Full reviw in Spanish]"
rotten," For about an hour or so, ""Unknown"" is intriguing."
rotten," True to this chauvinistic genre, Gerwig is a vacuum who lives to serve the house, the man and the mechanics of Baumbach's script."
rotten," For inferior horror films to work, they must be populated with characters who act irrationally at best and downright idiotically at worst."
fresh," I am now officially a Harry Potter fan. And that, I think, is the highest compliment a movie can get."
rotten, 'Nothing that you haven't wept or winced through during primetime TV but saved from the truly awful thanks to the performances of Judd and Jackman.'
rotten," Couldn't we just watch a Behind-the-Music and get the same greatest hits package in 100-less minutes than another dry, maybe-worthy-for- movie-of-the-week- status, biopic?"
fresh, Coming-of-age drama deals with heavy themes. 
rotten," If Venom ends up becoming the Green Lantern (that Tom) Hardy makes on the way to something better, then all Hardy's effort will have been worth it."
rotten," It's everything and nothing, a familiar regurgitation of a formula with precious little to add."
rotten," A clever, amusing little film, but its smugness about being more politically correct than Disney is misplaced."
fresh, A first-rate adaptation!
fresh, Iannucci's triumph is so consummate you may want to go back to media coverage of the era with the added insight it affords.
rotten," Only the motives of Baumbach's alter ego are pure. Meanwhile, the most entertaining questions - Can people transcend wide age gaps? Should they want to? - turn out to be beside the point."
fresh," Since Nina is hallucinating so often, she loses the ability to tell what is real and what is not. The problem is, so does the audience."
rotten," It feels like more of the same, a cinematic equivalent of getting another fruit cake as a holiday gift."
rotten, Zarafa fails to supply an emotional punch to match the grandeur of its Lawrence of Arabia-inspired compositions.
rotten, Much of it has a pleasing air of accuracy. But Redford's inability to suggest any irony about himself finally sinks it -- it's the only sanctimonious satire you'll ever see.
fresh, It's a gem of an adaptation I hope becomes a classic.
rotten," Whannell navigates a sometimes intriguing, mostly slipshod narrative on technological dependence that summons the memory of better, more accomplished films of this type. "
fresh, Lots of what they say is bonkers; all of it is engrossing.
fresh," Eight Legged Freaks is clever and funny, is amused by its special effects, and leaves you feeling like you've seen a movie instead of an endless trailer."
fresh, Okay whodunit suffers by comparison with Murder on the Orient Express.
fresh, First-time filmmaker Miller generally does an effective job of drawing the viewer into the less-than-innovative storyline...
rotten," It all leads to growing pains of the usual kind, the kind you've seen before in other, better, gay coming-of-age movies."
rotten," ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" brings to mind some of the most unforgettable sci-fi event movies of the last 30 years. Alas, those films are ""Howard the Duck"" and ""Green Lantern."""
fresh," The Campaign is an equal split of smart and stupid. Some people may be off-put by the wild detours into vulgarity, but I relished it."
fresh," Rudd and Hirsch have great chemistry, and Green gives them room to develop their characters with a languid pace and unobtrusive style."
rotten, The only thing amazing about Marc Webb's reboot is how quickly a Hollywood studio can forget the lessons its own films have taught it.
fresh," Revealing portrayal of an artist's method, and beautiful to look at -- but like ""Roma,"" maddeningly slow. "
rotten," Unlike Cage's reliable merchandise in the film, Niccol's supposedly explosive exposé misfires with every other shot."
fresh," An amusing if dispensable mockumentary from former ""Saturday Night Live"" funnyman Taran Killam, who wrote, directed and stars."
fresh," However specific its time frame and focus, BPM is not a narrow nostalgia piece, nor will it ever be as long as people are still dying, still being vilified. "
fresh," Shotgun Stories is a cautionary tale about revenge, but more than that, it is a beautiful, authentic-feeling portrait of a family and a place."
fresh," a slick, smart, and subversive look at where America went wrong with its geo-political thinking"
rotten," John McClane turns out to be such an annoying, bullying dad that as comedian Chris Rock might phrase it, 'I'm not saying his son Jack should shoot him ... but I'd understand.'"
fresh, Director Matthew Vaughn's franchise reboot or prequel or whatever it is has some artificial flavors but also some natural advantages in James McAvoy as the learned telepath Professor X and Michael Fassbender as his tormented friend Magneto.
rotten," Largely free of Sandler's usual schmaltz and lame romance, it's pure plotless, grotesque high jinks, bizarre and inept in a way that's fascinating without ever being all that funny."
rotten," In movie making, as in life, it's not enough to mean well. The real challenge is in being meaningful."
fresh," Sweet and sentimental, a bit racy to be a kids' film, a bit tame as grown-up entertainment, Son of Rambow is still a magical romp about childhood discovery and the birth of a lifelong love of the movies."
rotten, The lessons are so pat that every moment in which Pepper makes a good moral choice feels like an act of self-congratulation. 
fresh," It is 'cine-sadism' at its finest. Hits hurt; sweat drips; blood spatters; machetes slice; bones crunch and break; you'll gasp, you'll laugh, you'll applaud and you'll want to marvel at it again."
fresh," If you liked the HBO show, you're going to like what writer/director Doug Ellin puts on the big screen."
fresh, The ghost of Tex Avery is alive and well in a frenetic sequel that does more than reheat and serve. Madagascar 4? Don't bet against it.
fresh," With its cartoonish pace, larger-than-life characters and detours into farce and agitprop, this movie captures the accelerated pace of life in the financial markets and the vast scale of their mendacity far more vividly than a naturalistic drama could."
fresh," No film this year burrowed deeper into my consciousness this year than ANNIHILATION. Top that truly mindbender of a plot with excellent acting, beautiful visuals, and an awesome score and you have film at the height of its power."
rotten," One day, this still-unfolding situation might make for one hell of a movie. As long as Oliver Stone doesn't secure the rights."
fresh," If The Equalizer is the hit it should be, it will give this veteran action star his very first movie franchise."
rotten, Soa como uma mistura desajeitada de filme noir e da série de tevê Batman produzida na década de 60.
fresh," Yorgos Lanthimos's The Favourite is a filthy, violent and outrageous period comedy that drips with bad language and worse behaviour, and will appal anyone who is expecting a more conventional royal drama."
fresh," Sometimes Fast & Furious 6 is engrossing, sometimes absurd, and some of the action is so outlandish it makes the audience laugh. But whatever it is, it's always some variety of fun."
fresh," Sr. Jackson: vaya valor! (vaya par...!), y vaya logro!... La espera ser larga pero usted la ha hecho vlida ..."
fresh, Paranormal Activity trafficks in shadows and shivers yet is more malevolent than a dozen Hostels.
fresh," It's a pleasant surprise because Egyptian-Welsh writer-director Sally El Hosaini, in her feature film debut, avoids telling an easy but often overwrought sort of story about immigrants struggling to leave their history behind them."
rotten, Hart hits such adrenaline-fueled extremes it's exhausting.
rotten," Pattinson and Beltran are stuck with a rudderless script, and they make a soft, dull pair."
fresh," It startles you with effects that go back to cinema's origins, a technique that paradoxically feels more revolutionary than regressive."
fresh," For fans of the Quentin Tarantino school of grisly, outre noir, Lee's take on ""Oldboy"" has a lot to offer ..."
rotten," Pacino. DeNiro. Armed and dangerous. In a cop drama. In NYC. Together. Written by the writer of Inside Man. Sounds great, doesn't it? Well, what could've gone so wrong?"
fresh, Jarmusch appreciates the value of an evocative soundtrack.
rotten," After the first 10 minutes, which is worth seeing, the movie sinks into an abyss of clichés, depression and bad alternative music."
rotten, Timely but confused Black Hawk Down wannabe.
fresh," Terrifically well-acted by all, sharply scripted by Sorkin and directed by Danny Boyle with his usual caffeinated, color-drenched intensity, a nice match for Sorkin's style."
rotten," Toggling between Stark's impish goatee and Iron Man's full-metal body condom, and amid so many generic fireballs, kill shots and earsplitting thumps, bumps and crunches, the film finally collapses under its own weight."
fresh," Never dull, always informative, and expertly crafted, Horror Noire: A History of Black Horror is a triumph of masterful execution, engaging storytelling, and brutal honesty."
rotten," I'm surprised the filmmakers didn't kick caution in the you-know-what and call the movie, Mr. Peabody & Sherman and Butts."
fresh, Masterful suspense and horror from one of the greats.
fresh, A carefully structured scream of consciousness that is tortured and unsettling--but unquestionably alive.
fresh, The film doesn't finish its meal before moving onto dessert; abandoning a satisfying conclusion in favour of starting work on the inevitable sequel. Naughty Hollywood! Eat your greens!
rotten," In short, it probably should have been titled 'Eat Pray Love Sleep' as it becomes increasingly difficult to fight off the latter while watching it. (Parental Review also Available)"
fresh," Southpaw is a terrific boxing movie, with choreographed violence emphasizing the sport's speed rather than its poetry in slow motion."
fresh, This is a movie worth seeing.
fresh," builds a surprising amount of suspense... It's sometimes agonizing to see these young faces fall as they confront such enemies as ""obsimath,"" ""cephalagia"" and the dreaded ""kookaburra""..."
fresh," After all the other films that seem to be aimed at them and really aren't, little children and the people who love them could really use a slice of simply delicious cake like this."
rotten," Despite a solid set it, The Invitation descends into boring schlock by the third act is all the more disappointing considering what's come before."
fresh," A strikingly intimate second sequel that fully delivers on the empathy ""Rise"" introduced and ""Dawn"" developed, making viewers feel just about everything for these damn dirty apes."
rotten, A film with as much substance as a very long beer ad.
fresh," This deftly scripted and unusually affecting installment of the long-running series is marked by the notable return of director Bryan Singer, who succeeds in delivering a film that ranks among the very best of the franchise."
fresh, Moneyball isn't just a great baseball movie; it's a great movie about baseball - and there's a difference.
fresh," One of Sylvio's greatest strengths is the ever-present, though never fully verified sense that Birney and Audley are having a long laugh at their audience's expense."
fresh," Christopher Nolan's astonishing new film, a retelling of the Allied evacuation of occupied France in 1940, is a work of heart-hammering intensity and grandeur that demands to be seen on the best and biggest screen within reach."
fresh," Feels like a singular, fully realised entity, rather than a glorified teaser trailer for another crossover feature, and has some genuinely inspired and satisfying surprises amidst its familiar trappings."
fresh," The ""heaven"" experience is not presented as a shocker but rather as a true event that happened to a family; that makes this a movie that all audiences will enjoy."
rotten," Even its jolts of surrealism feel curiously stilted; what it needed was a director whose reverence would be tempered by a healthy sense of the ludicrous, an ability to tap into and draw out the material's stranger undercurrents."
fresh," The climactic 20 minutes or so represent the most electrifying depiction of rap that the multiplex is likely to see, a torrent of word-slinging packed with atmosphere and ribald drama."
fresh," Chow habitués will be primed for hyperbolic acting, ludicrous wirework, ugly CGI and outlandish action sequences. Rest assured, those points will be satisfied."
rotten," There's a reason nobody's made a motion picture about the Bondurant Boys before now. As ruthless, gun-toting gangs go, they're kind of on the snoozy side."
rotten, A little like Jack the Ripper in outer space.
rotten, A valuable reflection of contemporary celebrity culture - simply because it shows us how low we've fallen.
fresh," Though it drifts off into the ozone at the end, for most of its running time, ""Never Here"" is a low-key but effective psychological thriller which flirts with that looming issue of the social-media age: privacy, and the invasion thereof."
fresh," Director Eric Brevig knows he's not really shooting a Jules Verne mind-blower; this is pure blockbuster, and it's a fine specimen."
fresh," An engaging if superficial sit, not just for his fans but also for anyone who seeks to understand cinematic grammar and the often un-pretty process of how movies get made."
fresh, [A] handsome and heartfelt study of the America neglected by the cosmopolitan elite.
rotten, The uninventive Happy Death Day 2U can neither sustain nor recreate the charms of the first film by recycling its ideas.
fresh," If ever there were a happy summer movie, it's Hairspray."
rotten," Inarritu, not content to just lay it on thick, smothers his canvas with self-important gloom."
rotten, Almost every good moment in the film is sandwiched between two bits that aren't nearly as well built.
rotten," Yet I say unto thee that this hath many moments which be good-ish and watch-able enough and by-the-Book, and yet smacketh of being too graven and tablet-y in their images. If only this wereth not a moment-y mega-movie but an actual, feeling-filled film..."
fresh," Jumps adroitly between the macho and anti-macho, the romantic and anti-romantic."
fresh, The film explores the horrors and the wonders of our current way of life.
fresh," Ultimately, it's the hip cast that keeps things hopping."
rotten," SIGN UP Instead of nurturing his kooky inventions the director keeps moving to the next one, with an absentminded 'quick, look over there!' approach channelling his inner Dory."

rotten," Downright torture for adults, it may prove too unsophisticated even for its preteen target audience."
rotten," Once the money shots of Darren Aronofsky's version recede, it becomes ever more clear that his intention is to tackle the capriciousness of Old Testament logic. And, ultimately, to assent to it."
rotten," Many of the scenes feel shapeless and flat-they're not ended, but abandoned."
fresh, Classic Linklater high schooler story with great characters.
rotten, Writer Simon Fuchs begins with a reasonable idea -- we're all likely to be curious about the origins of Peter Pan -- and does unreasonable things ever after.
rotten, The worst problem with the movie is its inability to rise above the muddle of ideas with which it toys.
rotten, This remake plays like the high school version of a big Broadway stage show. Although that's probably unfair to high school theater. 
rotten," Director Patrick Tatopoulos is in over his head with a movie that should, but probably won't, put a final nail in Underworld's monochromatic coffin."
rotten," Here is a nicely photographed, but bland, insipid and weirdly passive-aggressive little film."
rotten, There's enjoyment to be had out of seeing Cox and company inhabit these roles - it's just a shame they don't have a better movie wrapped around them. 
fresh," This chilling and intense coming-of-age horror exerts a powerful grip. Even if you're not especially faint-of-stomach, you'll re-think going out for steak afterwards."
rotten," A tedious, shallow soap opera that wastes the time of everyone involved. "
rotten," Its makers have somehow convinced themselves that there's not only a story we care about, but an arc to be followed."
fresh, Nappily Ever After is a story that we may have seen before in one form or another - but is still one worth retelling in its own way.
fresh, Both very funny and very flawed.
fresh, Its conceptual wit and its merciful brevity help it go down easy.
rotten, It's just director Frank Coraci deciding that continuity is for saps.

rotten, Running on empty...
rotten," The film has a few laughs, but none of the sweetness of My Big Fat Greek Wedding."
rotten, When Roberts should be avoiding the potholes of sentimentality and cliche ... he drives straight at them.
rotten," There are points where the film is satirical, then sad, then outrageous, but it just never quite fits of a piece. "
fresh," As the chain of events unfold, the wit is very nicely interspersed with hard-hitting moments of greed and deceit providing a shock-and-awe effect that leaves you wondering how vulnerable can a common man be."
rotten, An exploration of the results such a situation could bring ... [T]hose results are admittedly predictable and formulaic.
fresh," In its splendid acting by Ryan Golsing and Michelle Williams (in Oscar-caliber performances) and brutal honesty, this relentlessly grim portrait of marital dissolution is up there with the best of the genre, including Shoot the Moon and Smash Palace."
rotten," The worst case scenario of homogenized, generic filmmaking."
fresh, However mostly we leave with Zhao Tao's indelible face etched in our memories and proof once again that this a collaboration of director and actor that we want more of.
fresh," A hybrid of several genres where what matters is the fascinating following to its protagonist, a meticulous and intimate study of character. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh," Failed artists -- more specifically, failed writers -- play a central role in most of Noah Baumbach's films. In Greenberg, Baumbach embraces that failure."

fresh, Doctor Strange is a psychedelic extravaganza that's sure to spin heads with its trippy effects and tongue-and-cheek wit.
rotten," Rothe is the closest thing to a saving grace here; she has presence and wit and looks. If she can manage to drag herself clear of having to do junk like this, she may even have a future."
rotten," Its computer sequences exist in a blue-gray scheme filled with flashing lights, speeding objects and dizzying motion. Its visual effects are wonderfully new. They are also numbing after a while."
fresh," Fabulously stacked with furiously over the top, in a good way, action. Call it Car Wars. "
fresh," Arquette is charmingly endearing as the frustrated Jeanne, Wilson movingly conveys his character's vulnerability as well as his bluster and McLean is terrific as the beleaguered young girl desperate to have a mane like Farrah Fawcett's."
fresh," Directed with the true eye of a horror master, with a smartly written script by the series' creator, Kevin Williamson, ""Scream 4"" is what a horror movie should be. Fun."
rotten," Instead, what he gave us was World War Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
fresh, [Nobody's Watching] is a magnificent character portrait. [Full Review in Spanish]
fresh," Oyelowo and Pike are perfect together, conveying a deep well of love buoyed by joy and fierce loyalty."
rotten," Instead of embracing its pulpy nature, it aims for seriousness, then gives us cornpone performances, a lightning bolt that triggers a tractor's ejector seat, and a simple-minded view of saintly black folk who possess a dangerous blues."
rotten," Going into Cop Out you should expect the expected, a spoof of a comedy that is not an Oscar winner, but rather the first stupidly entertaining film of 2010."
rotten," Despite visual snazziness, it's not a fresh enough film to sway anyone who has tired of its genre."
rotten," Based on William Paul Young's best-selling 2007 novel, this endlessly earnest but ultimately unconvincing film serves up plenty of cheese with little depth."
rotten, The problem with the film is that it starts at such a lethal pitch there is nowhere believable it can build toward.
rotten, Hardwicke's envisioning rarely achieves the sort of nightmarish quality the material suggests.
rotten, ... an anti-American rant that tediously plays out as a misplaced lecture by the pretentious filmmaker.

rotten, One for real horror-buffs only.
rotten," Nothing, absolutely nothing that you see has even the minimum coherence. [Full Review in Spanish] "
fresh," Kempner's film shows the difference one person can make by telling Rosenwald's story, a critical history lesson and a welcome reminder of our own tikkun olam obligations."

fresh, Jones displays such a complete command of his narrative that it is hard to believe this is his first feature.
rotten," Except for children, who might find this a breathless gift, the film's personality is defined by its locomotive: showmanship."
rotten," Wood's not an interesting psycho-just numb, mumbling, and dull. Pretty unpersuasive."
fresh, It's a journey of self-belief and discovery signposted just a little too heavily that is saved by more than a smattering of the type of writing that fits Fey like a glove and gives Freeman his best role since Watson.
fresh," A smart film made with strong talent, but none of them seem to be operating at their best - and it shows"
fresh," HPATDH 2 works like a charm. A funereal charm, to be sure, but then, there's no time left for larks."
fresh," In this earnest expression of horror and fear, it's not just the nerves which are shot to pieces. There's much stiff upper lip talk of putting on a good show. And this very fine British film certainly does just that."

rotten, [This] 'guilty pleasure' ends guilty of not living up to its potential.
fresh, A cerebral and hard film to watch with lots of psychological implications. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten," Pushes things into violent, hardcore territory all too similar to Danny Boyle's zombie-outbreak flick 28 Days Later and its 2007 sequel."
rotten, What the f#?! were Billy Bob and his two Bad Santa screenwriters thinking by turning a beloved family film into the equivalent of Bad Buttermaker?
fresh," Apart from my disappointment that Roger Moore didn't use any funny Bond-related lines (let's face it, ""license to drill"" or ""for your eyes only"" would have been hilarious coming out of his mouth), the movie more than exceeded my expectations."
rotten," John Travolta returns as the reformed mobster he played in Get Shorty. But while Get Shorty rode the Pulp Fiction craze with finesse, Be Cool is running on empty."

rotten," Kristen Stewart is really pretty good here, although like almost all actresses she believes pregnant women rub their baby bumps unceasingly."
rotten," There is absolutely no sense of danger ... for that matter, there's little urgency at all to answering what should have been the story's primary question."
rotten," An original movie, though not Tim Burton's best."
rotten," ""CBGB"" ain't no party, it ain't no disco, it ain't no foolin' around."
fresh," For as engaging as the film is in its best moments, its breadth-over-depth approach leaves the whole thing feeling glossy but a little hollow."
rotten," Compare it with the book, and it stinks. Look at the film on its own, and it still stinks."
fresh, The conversation between the elderly professor and the call girl is amusing and mysterious in equal parts.
fresh," Friends and former colleagues address the lingering question of whether Downey was being sincere or engaging in an elaborate form of performance art. (The answer: By the end of the show's run, Downey himself could scarcely tell the difference anymore.)"
fresh," Will Ferrell is like the North Atlantic Ocean of comedy, the link between black British absurdist humour and boisterous American slapstick."
rotten, It's a dark day indeed when a movie's funniest moments involve Donny Osmond.
rotten," Director Tom McGrath and team deliver some keen observations on growing-family dynamics and a number of laughs, but they run out of story a while before putting this one to bed."
fresh," Light Sleeper is emblematic of an era, and is recommended on that basis and on the excellent quality of it acting."
fresh," Up In The Air is not only a funny, satirical delight as well as a beautifully crafted thoughtful observation on society, but it is also refreshingly different, and a film that prompts a second viewing even as you enjoy the first ride."
fresh," Believability is overrated, and it's much more satisfying to let go of our plausibility needs and sit back to enjoy Miss Sloane's near-supernatural powers of strategic anticipation."
fresh, Mostly it remains enjoyable for its color and visual flair.
fresh," For all its fluffed moments and saggy end, how many other films this year feature a donkey with an erection?"
rotten, An oddball endeavor that doesn't entirely work...
fresh, Although Meryl Streep and Phillip Seymour Hoffman are certain to dominate all discussion ... Viola Davis steals the film in its most memorable scene
fresh," Sweet without being sticky and with just enough sourness to keep things real, this is a romantic comedy that delivers in both departments."
rotten, Seems bound to the conventions of crime and revenge tales to the point where everything in it works toward those conventions without much regard to thematic cohesion.
rotten, It makes us wonder what all the fuss is about.
rotten, Overall the film is less than the sum of its extravagant plaudits.
rotten, So we have a fundamentally earnest movie that mocks tongue-in-cheek movies for their earnestness.

fresh, A spiritually riveting film about a nasty thug in a Johannesburg shanty town whose violent and selfish life is totally transformed.
rotten," At a recent screening, I was amused by the audience laughing at several moments on screen that didn't seem intended as comic relief. I'm guessing they were desperate for something to enjoy."
fresh," Hot Fuzz appears to be England's attempt to prove to Hollywood that it can make brawny, blustery blockbusters every bit as noisy as those churned out by Tinseltown on a weekly basis."
rotten," Sure, there are some decent action scenes and star Taron Egerton has loads of insouciant charm. But that's about it. The rest is sporadically engaging drivel."
rotten, The most debilitating thing about this whole soggy mince pie of a picture is that it's narrated by a dog.
fresh," Like a Porter song, De-Lovely has melancholy, wit and style to burn."
fresh," Napoleon Dynamite may be forcefully weird and intermittently humorous, and you might not know what the heck to make of it, but there's nothing shocking about its screenplay."
fresh," So much happens in Roma. It is so bursting with life, Mexican life."
fresh," It's nonsense, but somehow irresistible."
rotten, A movie that gleefully panders to its audience's crudest instincts in every scene.
rotten," Sydney White has a concept and a title, but beyond that it draws a blank."
fresh, There is something hypnotically unbridled about Brooks's performance.
rotten," Words and letters may hold all the secrets of the universe, but 104 minutes wasn't enough to hold and resolve all the secrets and mysteries of Bee Season. "
rotten," Are you sure Guy Ritchie didn't direct this??? The attempt to make a faster and furiouser Robin Hood ain't all that , although it IS better than King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword but that is not saying a whole lot."
fresh," Much of the book's subtlety survives the translation. And the substance, for anyone with even a passing interest in philosophy and theology, is fascinating, valuable and timely."
rotten," Lacking the faith in God and Hollywood kitsch that motivated Cecil B. DeMille, Ridley Scott's modern-day Bible epic is much less gripping than any movie with plagues of frogs and boils ought to be."
rotten," The product placement for Harvey's book is a blatant disregard for the audience's intelligence. I felt like I was watching a 3am ""ShamWow"" infomercial! "
fresh," The best kind of homage or parody, the type that honors every thrill and quirk of the original while improving on it."
fresh," To watch ""In Jackson Heights"" is to feel like you're a part of it."

fresh," Yimou Zhang's gift for visual imagery is always a pleasure to behold...his eye for epic scale, pageantry, and battle is superb."
fresh," More tasteful, sensitive and original than you might imagine."
rotten, Doesn't quite take its satire far enough. 
rotten, Competently made.
rotten, A gumbo of silly mumbo-jumbo no more frightening than a Mardi Gras mask.
fresh," It's not a perfect template - running motifs are glaringly flagged up and there are at least two too many climaxes - but for both gags and thrills, few current British filmmakers come close."
rotten, So far past its sell-by-date it ought to come with a complimentary funeral wreath.
fresh, Vigalondo's film is very funny in places but the characters are undercooked.
rotten," The young dancers' undeniable skill and athleticism is squandered in this formulaic, overly familiar dance movie."
rotten," This is, essentially, a very long outtakes reel."
fresh," An extraordinary film, operating simultaneously at visceral, psychological and spiritual levels as it takes us on a voyage into space with the fate of mankind at stake."
rotten," A lot has been lost in the translation, which is a shame because there is the potential there for this intrepid young woman and Jennifer Lawrence has an amazing screen presence."
rotten," A strident, condescending Hollywood melodrama."
rotten, A forced and flaccid affair.
rotten, I would call Mortal Engines the most stupefyingly wrongheaded post-apocalyptic movie since Kevin Costner's The Postman but I fear its unrelenting drabness makes it even worse.
rotten, Although Ghost Dimension offers the series' fans some sort of closure it's all a bit limp and lame and can't offer up even the mildest of scares.
rotten," French art films aren't generally known for their feel-good endings, but a total lack of resolution can be just as cloying as happily ever after."
rotten, Spacey's devotion to Darin may have blinded him to the bigger picture.
rotten," ...does have some beautiful imagery, but it is randomly put together, fails to identify about half the creatures we see, and features some often nonsensical narration."
fresh," One of the most mythologized war stories of all time gets a profoundly earthbound, humanistic treatment."
fresh," The resulting film feels a little rough, but as long as you don't look it in the mouth it should appeal to those who like a good under-horse story."
fresh," Franklin is known for being good with actors, but Out Of Time also reveals his flair with machines, which too often dominate the plots of latter-day noirs."
rotten," Zombies. Nazis. Clichés. Insane violence. ""Overlord"" delivers a whole lot of much too much."
rotten, An unrealistic representation of the music industry.
rotten, The venerated American export that The Company Men most recalls isn't seagoing vessels -- it's hourlong dramatic television shows.
fresh," Bright, both in its color palette and in the wit and liveliness of the storytelling."
rotten," Everything about ""In a Better World"" feels just a little too easy: a better movie might have let in more of the messiness of the world as it is."
fresh," While Smashed documents both the crazy highs and the terrifying lows of addiction, the story is primarily about commitment."
fresh," ""Marguerite"" is a dark delight, a cringe comedy that skirts tragedy throughout, examining delusion, entitlement, denial and the question of whether the truth is essential."
fresh," Caucus allows moviegoers to tag along, like a silent observer forbidden from asking questions, in the run-up to the Iowa Caucus in January 2012."
fresh," A gloriously gilded wonderland - the stuff of dreams, on view for everyone."
rotten," An elaborate disaster, full of the kind of facetious humor you might find on bumper stickers and cocktail coasters."
rotten," As far as the Asian horror remakes go, I've seen a lot worse... But then again, I've seen a lot better."
fresh, Can we give it a rating of PG-10 or PG-11? 
fresh," Elegant, enchanting re-imagining of the romantic folk tale for the 21st century..."
fresh, Patti Cake$ just feels stuck between being a music video and a fully realized film.
fresh," A stiff central performance diminishes its emotional impact, but the visually alluring film's sensuality and tenderness give it a lingering spell."
fresh," ...a good, atmospheric stepping stone in the Potter chronology, with yet something missing to make it an entirely satisfying movie on its own. (Ultimate Edition, Blu-ray)"
fresh," It's a domestic horror story that literally gets to us where we live, a disturbing tale told with uncompromising emotionality and great skill by filmmaker Lynne Ramsay."
rotten, What this revival needs is a good kick in the pants. And that Ephron and friends lack the low cunning to deliver.
fresh, Compelling and at times heartbreaking.
fresh," Her quest is a well-executed one of universal appeal, so much so that the fact she can shoot proton beams seems of little import. "
fresh," Impressive, immersive, unsettling, and deeply unpleasant, a seriously scary film that painstakingly put me in a world I didn't like being in very much."
rotten, A Prairie Home Companion is about as charming as waking up with a dead animal in your bed.
rotten, Every Who down in Who-ville liked Christmas a lot. But Director Ron Who-ward saw gold in a pot.
rotten," A solid voice cast (Harris, Holbrook et al) doesn't add much more than cosmetic touches to this bland animation."
rotten, The concept deserves more than heroes and villains pointing guns at each other.
rotten," The film suffers from the same problems as last year's On The Road, namely an undue reverence towards its characters."
fresh, Eh...you could do a lot worse this summer.
rotten," No doubt, I'm not the target demographic for this movie. And I could be wrong. But I'd be shocked, and dismayed, if it's a hit, and even more shocked and dismayed if it begets a new Mike Myers franchise. "
rotten," Boulevard was Williams's last movie, which means its melancholy lands a little harder than it would have otherwise."
rotten," Jack Reacher revolves around wild impossibilities and baffling motivations, and the conclusion is a whopper that outdoes everything I've discussed above."
rotten," When it comes to romantic chemistry, they never quite mesh, no matter what twinkle effect Waters puts on the screen when Ruffalo's hand touches Witherspoon's ethereal plane."
fresh," Yet another small gem from the strong Sundance class of 2004, Mean Creek mines credible drama from teenage revenge fantasies."
rotten, The running time of 2 hours and 45 minutes allows plenty of time for lots of explosions and inane dialogue.
rotten," In the movie's last hour, writer-director David Twohy pretends to explore his stick figures' moral choices, and he forgets to deliver the thrills."
fresh," Marion Cotillard is a tearful, too-lovely newcomer to a harsh America in the early 1920s."
rotten, Nymphomania is not all it's cracked up to be.
rotten," Both discordant and disingenuous, this faux-profound final note suggests that Berg and screenwriter Matthew Michael Carnahan don't know what kind of movie they've actually made -- or would like to pretend they've made another kind."
rotten, Many a critic has said that there's nothing worse than an unfunny comedy...and Are You Here proves that point over and over again.
fresh, In lesser hands this would fall flat because nothing is written to comfort the supporting players. They are extras with names and blurred faces.
rotten," The best parts are, not surprisingly, the ample musical interludes. The character vignettes run hot and cold, with many registering as little more than quirky caricatures."
fresh," Intimates crime as the ultimate aphrodisiac, when it comes to rekindling doomed conjugal bliss. Move over, Viagra and sex toys."
rotten, The action tropes handled so well in the film's first half are pushed aside for clumsy melodrama by the end of the film.

fresh, A moving portrait of a courageous young man with Lou Gehrig's Disease who seeks to make his death fruitful to others.
fresh," I've Loved You So Long transcends its melancholy subject matter thanks to a terrific, restrained performance from Kristen Scott Thomas which should earn her some attention when time comes to hand out nominations and then awards."
rotten, Fun Mom Dinner is the equivalent of mom using bargain basement ingredients to make your favorite homecooked meal. 
fresh, Asserts its ambitions with its title and goes on to explore the very nature of truth and our willingness or ability to uncover and recognize it. 
rotten, A slick and clean cut piece of slacker comedy with great production and a fun sound track but sadly lacking in edginess.
fresh," How can you possibly match or even top that splendid soiree for the Peruvian bear? You'd think it would be an impossible task, but marvellously King has somehow shocked us once more."

rotten," While convincingly '50s in look and style, and with good work from Pattinson (who we almost wind up liking!) and DeHaan (whose JD isn't quite as much of a narcissistic creep as the real thing), Corbijn's latest still irritates."

rotten," Well, it's better than ""Tammy."" By a smidge."
fresh," Unlike most movies that deal with women's issues, this is one that can be enjoyed equally by guys rather than being so fueled by estrogen that it's unbearable."
fresh," This smart, stomach-turning look at what happens when you find yourself way over your head will go down as a well-deserved, punk rock classic."
fresh," You'd never know this was a debut film. Unlike Rudo and Cursi, who don't know their left from their right, Mr. Cuarón directs with a hand that's as sure as it is deft."
fresh, The fun of Rumble in the Bronx is watching Chan build up one inventive and off-the-wall action scene after another.
rotten," What is included on the DVD is mediocre, but it's what's not included that really hurts this release. "
rotten," By literally dehumanizing its antagonists, Citadel not only muddles its political message but also undermines the gravity of its main character's circumstances."
fresh," Mike Judge's Extract -- modest, no big deal but very savvy -- is the funniest American comedy of the summer."
fresh, ...a thoroughly contrived romantic comedy that is spiked into the end zone by its engaging cast and shambling production design.
fresh," As unnecessary remakes go, this one has a strange pull. Willis is giving a genuine performance in the middle of all the carnage, building fine moments opposite Vincent D'Onofrio."
rotten, Audiences may feel that ultimately they're getting less than promised - and certainly less resolution than even the most ardent fans of art-house open-endedness might hope for.
fresh," For those who prefer their otherwise bitter politics lightly coated with sugar, this should suffice. A bolder remit wouldn't have hurt, though, given the source material."
fresh," Wilson is fitfully funny, but the episodic format prevents it from matching the droll delights of Ghost World."
fresh, One of the more palatable relationship comedies due to the notable chemistry between Segel and Blunt and a supporting cast who are constantly stealing scenes.
fresh," The prolific, adventurous Hitchcock, who never tired of experimenting with his camera and tone, is at his best in Psycho."
fresh," A movie fascinating to watch while asking us to contemplate moral relativity, the futility of life ... and other heady concepts you might fully expect to find in not just another comic book movie."
fresh," [It] could ultimately care less about the music when the psychology of this scene's progenitors is what intrigues. This is about aesthetic, notoriety, and paranoia."
rotten, Director Chris Weitz proves that The Golden Compass was no fluke: He really is a non-master of action.

rotten," Very violent, brainless explosion movie."
rotten," Even with all these talented performers, I was left with no sympathy for Nick's predicament -- the movie was way more painful than whatever he went through"
fresh," Filmed at whisker-height, this charming documentary enters the daily lives of the many street cats of Istanbul."
rotten, Anyone wanting to learn about the real Hitchcock will be disappointed - although Hopkins does get a gold star for a tongue-in-cheek impersonation of Alfred.
fresh," [S]o few movies make me laugh out loud, and I did do that more than once with this one, and that's reason for a minor celebration..."
fresh," Call Me By Your Name survives because of poignant screenwriting, keen directing, and tender acting."
fresh," Wes Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson were triumphant in delivering a fresh, smart, twisted, and ultra-violent slasher sequel that will not only please fans of the original trilogy, but introduce an entire new generation of kids to horror."

fresh," Coming from the figurative mouths of actual ANZACs grants 25 April a fresh, harrowing, intimate perspective."
rotten," I guess I was expecting too much of the old television show in this movie, and it didn't deliver any of that. They didn't even use the theme song, for crying out loud."
rotten, 20-something relationship crisis rom-com's are a predictable A to B to C. How they negotiate the alphabet determines the outcome. This one has too many awkward moments.
rotten," It's like Lord of the Flies by way of Michael Bay, only not nearly as awesome as that sounds."
rotten," Ritchie aspires to be a great British director, but his working his way through British icons - Sherlock Holmes wasn't even safe - does no one any good."
rotten," There are movies that deserve remakes, even movies that need remakes, but with Overboard, too often you're just left asking, ""Why?"""
rotten," Even people who find fashion really, really interesting will be bludgeoned brain-dead by this fawning, attention-deficit infomercial of a documentary."
fresh," Bill Murray is perfectly cast and his performance is understated, like the entire film. He deserves an Oscar nomination."
fresh," Beautifully observed, and beautifully acted by the novice thespian Polanco (culled from a New York City public school), Chop Shop is at once a heartbreaker and a story of hope and the American Dream."
fresh," The Dark Knight Rises not only realistically tackles the physical and emotional ravages and consequences of a being Batman, but also makes the entire three-film story scintillatingly cyclical."
rotten," With a tighter control of his material, Judd Apatow might have made the wry, observant comedy he no doubt has in him."
fresh, Steers and his cast infuse Pride and Prejudice and Zombies with enough martial arts action and Austenian charm to keep this mad mashup on its feet and fighting to the end.
fresh, It's about the worldly doings of genuinely awesome intellect. Some of it has the intended effect. But don't be intimidated.
rotten," It's a curiously inert, workmanlike production: a whole lot of pomp and incircumstance."

fresh," A gonzo, gorgeous, brilliantly executed nightmare of a film."
fresh," As good as the actors are, the mall deserves a supporting credit. "
fresh, I don't believe that the cure for our hashtag-flawless-obsessed culture is easy encouragement. But you don't have to save the world to make a good movie.
rotten," Its saving grace is also its downfall: there is no sappy sentiment, but no emotional pull, either."
rotten," The heart of T2 lies in the relationship between Renton and Sick Boy, but their rocky reunion is another victim both to the wheel-spinning innate in Hodge's script and Boyle's relative lack of fresh ideas. "
fresh," The Orphanage is first and foremost a weighty, at times heartbreaking, existential study of the frailty of life, the mysteries of death, and the knowledge of one's own mortality. It is also very, very scary."
fresh," Richard Linklater wraps novelist Philip K. Dick's paranoid, prescient nightmare of addiction and identity lost down the rabbit hole in the same rotoscoped animation that helped produce the blissed-out groove of his Waking Life."
fresh," Spider, David Cronenberg's latest, shows the director once again at the top of his form."
rotten," Is ""the Love Witch"" a parody? It sure feels like it. But I'm not sure Biller intended it to be one."
fresh," It may not be a definitive look at the HBCU Greek experience, but it succeeds in being a nuanced look at the problem of hazing on any college campus."
fresh," Makes use of pink-fleshed vertebrates as the inspiration for sweet romantic musings on love and life, faith and patience - and the courage to go against the flow."
fresh, A star-making turn from the Olsen twins' baby sis will put this disturbing drama on the map.
rotten, ... Underworld: Evolution registers visually but isn't alive enough to cast a reflection or shadow.
rotten, There are a few fun moments here but not enough to overcome the film's many flaws.
fresh," In making the leap this holiday season from a Dame to a Broad, Judi Dench has chosen to apply her inestimable talents to a tried and true fork in the thespian road."
rotten, the film is too distant and too shiny to thoughtfully reflect on contemporary French cultural issues
fresh, [Serkis is} a revelation as Drury...
fresh," Roth, by presenting his characters as victims of the same world of flesh-for-fantasy they were grooving on in the first place, digs deep into the nightmare of a society ruled by the profit of illicit desire."
rotten," The most frightening thing for me was the realization that I have seen every one of these movies, and that I will no doubt see the next one, too."
rotten," Mars Attacks! wants to be the Dr Strangelove of alien B-movies, but isn't up to the challenge. Instead it's a paceless, overlong, and campy film partly redeemed by a number of hilarious and gruesome alien invasion skits."
fresh," Améris's recipe here calls for everything in moderation, resulting in a movie that never threatens to offend nor, particularly, to delight, though it does offer a good view on a modestly charming actors' duet."
fresh," What could have been a one-joke movie - Adam and Eve but Adam is super awkward - benefits from Löw's performance, which is both understated and physically demanding, as well as Köhler's rigorous focus on character quirks over the sci-fi conceit."
fresh," A new chapter in the expanded universe of J. K. Rowling is born and, I must be say, is a pleasant surprise. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten," Acting is best left to actors, lest you get this kind of shiftless, awkwardly mumbling emptiness going on for the entire length of a very drearily slow-moving movie."
fresh," There's bleak realism behind the comedy, Cruttenden's twitchy performance suggesting that power games in this household are nothing new. The final scenes, anarchic and glorious, will not easily be forgotten."
fresh," it's spring break kitsch, these girls following the yellow-stained road through Oz, with Franco as The Scarecrow, The Tin Man, AND The Lion. "
rotten, The film has an unrelenting staccato quality. Some would say a jackhammer quality.
rotten, Wait before you shell out your super cash to see this one. My So-So Ex will be available at a rental store super-soon enough.
fresh," It's a cornerstone of the French New Wave, and one of the greatest movies about childhood, from anywhere, ever."
rotten," Not thrilling enough as a thriller and not outrageous enough as satire, Velvet Buzzsaw is merely a Netflix-level Nocturnal Animals . "
fresh," This is a movie that defies understanding even as it compels reverent, astonished belief."
rotten," The film is nicely shot in New York and subtitled ""One moment can change your life forever"". There's not a moment here likely to change ours."
rotten," Hysteria is nicely played and has its fair share of decent moments, but the script struggles to find the right tone and it's hard to escape the feeling that the actual true story might have been a bit more interesting."
rotten, A big screen B-movie with a convoluted plot and limited scope - inundating viewers with melodrama instead of the alien invasion apocalypse occurring outside.
fresh, ... cunning meditation on the birthing grounds of religious extremism ...
rotten," Never have so many curbside trash containers been violated in the name of art, as well as trees, a mailbox, and a forlorn electric pole."
rotten, It rather puts things into perspective to note that 20 years ago this film's director Rob Minkoff raised the bar for animated storytelling as co-director of The Lion King. How times have changed.
fresh," There's so much swagger in 'Chi-Raq' that it's a little uneven; this movie is both small and immense, the same way that violence within a community can feel isolated to an area, but is also reveals a systemic worldwide problem."
fresh," Seen with forgiving eyes, Wedding Crashers is trashy, raunchy fun."
fresh," The surprising part is how, once you get over the crude humor that the teen-movie genre demands, Get Over It is a nice little movie."
fresh, The tensions wind up deliciously as we work our way to a penultimate celebration of a now-imperilled medium.
rotten," Flamboyant caricatures and casual prejudice have always been cornerstones of the Adam Sandler empire, and The Cobbler is no exception."
fresh," A relentless and shattering masterwork, 'Amour' breaks the heart but satisfies the soul."
fresh," The merits of Rocket Science are endlessly debatable, and this is nothing to sneeze at."
fresh," Waititi keeps the jokes coming thick and fast, delivering hi-jinks and heightened characters with an emotional undertow that really resonates."
rotten, 'Magic' was the one thing this movie desperately needed.
fresh," The Guilty is a bit of a gimmick film, but proves to be a sensationally effective one thanks to the combination of Moller's gifts as a filmmaker and the wonderful performance by Cedergren as the antihero at the center."
fresh," Into the Forest may get lost in the glut of post-apocalyptic films... If that's the case, it'll be a shame, for this adaptation of Jean Hegland's gently sci-fi novel is a more intimate film than many of those zombie-busters and doomsday thrillers. "
rotten," Not everything Madea says is gold, and yet the storyline will literally stop so we can hear the crazed crone go off for no particular reason."
rotten, The comic side isn't really that comic.
rotten," America's Muslim punk scene could certainly be considered underexplored, but why this generally bothersome indie drama has to be given such a bleached-out look is hard to fathom."
fresh," Weird but beautiful, this sci fi/horror/suspense gem is genre cinema that does a pretty good job at being original. [Full review in Spanish]."
rotten, A surprising dearth of action means kids may tire of this comparatively talky and character-driven film.
rotten," If there's one thing Cruise knows how to portray, it's robotic single-mindedness."
fresh," When a movie throws as much at you as Devdas does, it's easy to forgive minor disappointments."
rotten, Full of barely-defined characters having simulacrums of relationships with each other; but at least it's a looker.
rotten, Only 14-year old boys are this enamored with growing a mustache.
fresh," It is suspenseful. And then, at the end, it is beautifully fulfilling."
rotten," The Twilight Saga: New Moon takes the tepid achievement of Twilight, guts it, and leaves it for undead."
fresh, Even better than the first.
rotten," For a film that is supposed to be about the holiday spirit, ""The Night Before"" is rife with selfish and self-centered behavior by its major protagonists who, at times, seem to be friends simply because the script says so."
rotten," ...Spider-Man 2, despite a terrific villain, is boring."
rotten, Sporadically funny but ultra clunky and shallow.
fresh," Here is a piece of entertainment that will really make you sit up straight and think, a movie endowed with the challenge of a fascinating intellectual game."
fresh," All action scenes are conducted quite impressively, with a wild shootout inside the confines of El Pueblito ranking as the absolute standout."
fresh," It's an odd, melancholic experience that at times recalls Terrence Malick as it does A. A. Milne, but there will certainly be some viewers in its exact wheelhouse."
rotten, Its remote-controlled emotional responses leave little room for genuine uplift.
fresh, Bahrani is a gifted filmmaker. But he shoots himself in the foot by throwing in a contrived plot device that creates drama at the expense of credibility.
rotten," The ""How to Train Your Dragon"" movies are respected - the first two garnered nominations for Best Animated Feature - but this third chapter doesn't garner more than a polite appreciation."
fresh," Gray directs this handsome and evocative film with emotional restraint, making its archetypal title character a living individual whose moral journey is never simple."
fresh," Sanga creatively employs a swirl of text messages, voice-overs, baseball signals and other linguistic modes to beautifully illustrate the jumble of thoughts cascading through young minds."
fresh," A lyrical tale as sweet, simple and refreshing as a summer shower."
rotten, Isla Fisher is such a bundle of comic energy that watching her spin her wheels in the aggressively unfunny Confessions of a Shopaholic counts as cruel and unusual punishment -- for her as well as for us.
rotten," Initially diverting and thrilling, but with diminishing returns. It's excessively inane and cartoonish. Not enough pleasure to call it a guilty pleasure. "
rotten," There are a few odd left turns, such as the appearance of the rapper Common as a cool assassin, on the way to a lumbering and preordained conclusion."
fresh, A decisive transitional chapter in Chilean history yields an absorbing account of one country's unlikely route from oppression to democracy
rotten," Belladonna of Sadness is a delirious hodgepodge of ideas that lands somewhere between Faustian fantasy and feminist screed. If you're looking for an experiential analogy, imagine dropping acid before heading into a Women's Studies course."
fresh," While a plot contrivance late in the day ensures that an opportunity for a climactic battle sequence is not wasted, the film is not really an action epic, but a sweeping story about belief sets in the Arab world."
rotten," Moverman's adaptation of Herman Koch's novel is loaded with lacerating dialogue delivered with conviction. Yet as the narrative widens the drama loses steam and we're left recalling performance moments, Bobby Bukowski's camera work and little else."
fresh," A movie that starts strong and just builds, always pushing forward yet still finding time for interesting detours."
fresh," There are some nifty one-liners, too, from fleeting, anti-Canadian jibe, 'Take back Bieber', to this surreal putdown, 'You may have them fooled, but you and I both know that you are sketchier than a 2am waffle house'."
fresh," There are large portions here that are universally relatable, particularly the film's themes about fighting for freedom."
rotten," The takeout for parents? Well, you'll probably realise you are doing a lot better than either of these bozos."
fresh," Stranger, funnier. This is male bonding through f'd-up adversity, compared to what previously felt like acquaintances drunkenly coming to terms with their own simmering anger."
fresh," Even as the writers spin their entertaining suburban legend, there's a lingering feeling perhaps even they don't really stand behind the statement they're trying to make."
fresh," This is another one of those films that fits into the ""it is what it is"" category, only it's better than that. It is what it is and does it really, really well."
rotten, Makes the erroneous suggestion that a woman can't possibly create a life of beauty and meaning without the patter of little feet.
rotten, The film makes noises about female empowerment on one hand but sticks to the worst kind of racial profiling on the other.
rotten, Pegg exudes his usual air of faint self-congratulation playing an unlikeable prat whom nobody in their right mind would prefer to the high- flying Azariah or indeed to anyone.
rotten," Spice World is a disjointed mess. Loved the girls, hated the movie."
fresh," Bosch boldly tackles the psyche of Hitler, showing the Führer enjoying the high life with Eva Braun as he instructs his minions..."
fresh," Funny, surprising and full of heart...meatier than you'd expect, with lots of unexpected humor."
fresh," Nelson's film is a fairly straightforward police-file-and-talking-heads affair, energized by the use of Crowley's own storehouse of footage, and in essence positing him as a co-director."
fresh, The kind of don't-ask- too-many-questions action-hero movie where the humor is tasty and the FX are wicked-cool.
rotten," A film like this essentially suffers from what one might call like the domino cliché effect. Once the first cliché hits, it's impossible to stop the rest."
fresh," Somehow all these wrongs add up to an inexplicable right. It's why children love improvised bedtime stories -- a meandering, faulty narrative can be a ton of fun."
fresh," Suspense, social commentary, great performances and a seriously twisted outlook -- Gone Girl is one killer movie."
rotten, Amy Schumer and Goldie Hawn are able to keep the comedy afloat even when it struggles to find momentum.
rotten," Ruined by Hendler's pointlessly artsy direction, a stab at postmodern snarkiness and an unconscionable 101-minute running time."
rotten," 2.0 is dull as ditchwater in the first half, perking up a little in the second."
rotten," Less a cleverly spun story than a disjointed collection of shockeroos, surrounding a few ghoulishly effective moments with overcooked plot twists and in-your-face vulgarity."
fresh, Hilarious! some of Nichol's and Hoffman's best work.
rotten," Fallen is It's nothing but a weaker version of everything that has come before it, the mythos is convoluted and ultimately uninteresting, the CGI is ropey at best."
rotten," The appropriation of Brooks' name and source material seems more like an attempt to manufacture buzz and fan base attendance (subsequent disappointment and rage be damned) through the most shallow, cynical means possible."
rotten," The ocean-set peril grows monotonous, and the attempts to infuse Grainger's worry-girl role with some agency and dramatic urgency are noble, but largely unsuccessful."
rotten, Unfortunately for Butler it is another romantic comedy that misses the mark and does not score.
fresh," This well-paced story is tense and thoughtful, and is anchored by a trio of terrific performances."
rotten," In Bruges has some cracking lines in it, a cracking performance from Brendan Gleeson as Ken, and some very funny, provocative jokes, but I still don't know... It's just all the violence that did me in."
fresh, Arrival does what science fiction at its best should do: it make us look to the future in a way that allows us to think about the present in new ways.
rotten," With the feminist themes lurking in the background but never explored in a satisfying manner, The Keeping Room is hard to see as anything other than a missed opportunity."
rotten," Brooks, fumbling around with too many characters and too many issues, can't find the heart of the story or give heart to the part of it he chose to focus on."
rotten," Priyadarshan fails to convincingly establish the relationships between the various characters and the milieu. The largely functional performances don't help, and we never become emotionally involved with the characters."
fresh," I have to admit that I had a good time with this brain-dead slasher flick %u2013 not in spite of its myriad stupidities, but because of them."
rotten," Szumowska provides lurid scenes of perverted sex, but she offers no new insight into the sordid world of prostitution and the dangers sex workers face."
fresh," Shot over a three-year period with an affectionate, watchful eye, it blows up an intimate family portrait on to a large, cinematic canvas."
fresh, A passable imitation of a Hollywood disaster movie minus the campy elements ...
fresh," A biographical film that tries to break the mold and play with the pieces, where Jackie's troubled face is the perfect complement of Larraín's aesthetic. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh, It's hard to recall the last time a big-ticket summer movie delivered so fully on its promise.
fresh," Tough viewing, but required."
fresh," Gleeson is a wonderful actor and he keeps a lid on the blarney. He manages to convey a lot -- fear, anger, compassion, rue -- with only the slightest of squints and frowns. But he's still the center of a cooked-up cavalcade of souls."
rotten, The only redeeming quality of this film is Varun Dhawan and his comic timing that lightens the mood and makes some lines funnier than they would have been otherwise.
rotten, Western spoof that falls off the saddle too many times.
fresh, Shock of all shocks this is a Transformers movie that is actually quite terrific . Hailee Steinfeld and a lovable piece of metal are a big part of the reason.
rotten," The Forest comes off like a theme-park haunted house, complete with laughable skeletons that drop down from branches and look like they were purchased from the party costume aisle."
rotten," It's not much more than a ride; the plot is thin, the characters aren't very engaging, and it just lacks that storytelling spark that Pixar movies have year after year."
fresh, [Markus] Imhoof makes bees more important than they have previously seemed.
fresh, Not recommended to anyone backpacking this summer but everyone else will be perched on the edge of their seats.
rotten," As played by Ben Stiller, the character of Greenberg fails to transcend his abhorrent exterior."
fresh," If you are a fan of Smith, this is certainly worth checking out for a bargain matinee, but it won't stay with you for a very long time."
fresh, Let's just say this is a well paced thriller with a strong cast -- it's good to see Guy Pearce on screen -- but the terrorist threat which obsessed the recent Bush administration has been dwarfed by a couple of things...
fresh," As a fan of the books, I was skeptical that the movies could re-create their gentle, humane, messy spirit. But I'm happy to report that Ramona and Beezus captures the characters almost perfectly and that Joey King is an ideal Ramona."
fresh, A shocking indictment of how people are starving in the land of plenty ...
fresh," Knowingly melodramatic, wonderfully cheesy and all-out bonkers, The Guest is an absolute blast from beginning to end."
fresh," No more than a extended episode of the Twilight Zone from 1962, Life does have a nasty punch line in store and for that alone, it is smarter than your average sci-fi thriller."
rotten, Most of the film's shortcomings stem from the awkward combo of modern-day grotesquerie and fluffy romantic exoticism.
rotten," Lacking even a hint of humor or a watchable story, Disguise has distinguished itself as the summer's worst movie."
rotten, A horrible film bred from the isolation of a man at the top
rotten, The script's bowel-rupturingly bland - you can almost sense the bits where they wrote [INSERT JOKE HERE] and never got round to it.
fresh, This is basically The Art of War: The Movie.
rotten," It's very expensive and very busy, and it's utterly forgettable."
fresh," Model Agyness Deyn makes a spectacular starring debut in this visually impressive, low-budget British tale of a dysfunctional family."
fresh," The movie's a galvanizing, tragicomic work of 21st-century schadenfreude, marred only by a barely repressed giddiness on the part of the filmmakers. But why shouldn't they be dazzled by their good fortune?"
rotten, The movie doesn't end so much as it gives up.
fresh, I amaze myself by liking this latest lunatic cocktail as much as I do.
fresh, Full of chess game suspense. The movie offers a tense look at the hazards of mediating between enemies. 
rotten," Perhaps Elliott was trying to make a point about the futility of voyeurism, and if that's the case, it backfires, for it brings to light how much of a waste watching Eye of the Beholder is."
rotten," If nothing else, this might be the most heartwarming film ever made about masturbating into a plastic cup for money."
fresh," It's undeniable that the good-natured ""Afterschool Special"" vibe here plays to the film's corny strengths, and the dancing is impressive. So much so that it's almost impossible not to cheer during the final round."
fresh, Jordan Galland's Ava's Possessions begins where most demonic-possession movies end.
rotten," There's no real depth or texture to the characters of any sort, sentimental or otherwise, and I say that as someone who can be brought to tears by a Hallmark commercial."
fresh, We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch.
rotten," How nice it would have been had McKenna penned a couple of those audience-addressing interludes for Richard or Jack. What would these modern, succesful men tell us of themselves?"
fresh, Agnes is one of the most respectable and believable and satisfyingly human characters in a fiction film this year.
fresh, Herzog & Kinski = Logic and passion.
rotten, A dead-on-arrival comedy that's just as much in need of some brains as its title character.
fresh," The portrait of BASE jumping founding father Carl Boenish, effectively captures the irrepressible energy of a man who never tired of taking flying leaps."
fresh," A sweet, wispy little romantic comedy."
rotten," Under all the gimmickry and effects, there's a nice story to tell -- as anyone who has read the books knows."
fresh," A passionate plea for honesty, courage and standing up for what you believe in, Lions for Lambs is a powder keg of a film. It's a film to debate and discuss"
rotten," Considering what a commanding majority of the film's running time is made up of large-scale action scenes and chases in CGI environments, it's disastrous that only one of them is any good."
fresh, If only Alice Krieg had directed it herself.
fresh," L.A. Confidential is a rarity, a major Hollywood film with smart acting, dialogue and production values that actually works from beginning to end."
rotten, Like Big Trouble in Little China without the laughs.
fresh," A wonderfully populated adventure, with the franchise even more compelling the second time out because of our familiarity with the characters."
fresh, Common to successful sex comedies is a developing sense of self-awareness and the painfully sweet camaraderie of misfits. The naughty but nice Superbad can be added to that list.
rotten," A perfect mute-button movie, better seen than heard."
rotten," This new Ramona prefers mischief without real edge. You always know her parachute has a silver lining, even in an economic downturn. She is, above all, safe. And that makes her nowhere near as entertaining or enduring as the girl on the page."
fresh," It's worth watching for Hiddleston's performance and the pure spectacle of it, especially if you're a Del Toro fan, but otherwise there's not much to write home about."
rotten," This plodding, by-the-numbers superhero flick has all the feline grace of a walleyed mastiff."
rotten," Imagine being locked in a car with Charles Manson, Idi Amin and Osama bin Laden. The worst road trip ever? Nope. That honour belongs to Martin Lawrence's latest so-called comedy, which parks itself neatly between the words appalling and god-awful."
rotten, The Producers might work okay on stage but it collapses the second the same material and songs get in front of a camera.
fresh," In answer to the film's central question, this is exactly the type of story I like to be told, in all its facets and complexities, and I'm thankful for those that helped in the telling of it."
rotten, This painful background tale of the schoolgirl master of the really slow fireball attack almost makes one yearn for the days of Jean-Claude Van Damme.
fresh," Unlike many of the year's big-bang movies so far, it probably won't linger long in the memory. But then, not being any part of a larger franchise, it doesn't need to."
rotten," All the elements that could have made for a something worthwhile only deliver a painfully dull, over long, pretentious bore."
rotten," Zwick wants to have his cake and eat it, too -- and the result is an uneven, overlong bore. Call it Ramifying the Stone."
fresh, Hill's confidence keeps the formulaic buddy-cop cliches entertaining.
rotten, At times the movie plays like a sluggish road company of Entourage.
rotten," This exercise in classical blood-bath monotony does its job, but little more."
rotten," Please, never again."
fresh, This extremely violent movie is NOT for kids.
fresh," Wit, invention and shrewdly earned shocks abound in Drag Me to Hell. This burst blood-vessel of B-movie brilliance makes Raimi's rivals look like the corpse-grinding charlatans they truly are."
rotten," The basic formula of the freefall of action, laughs and casting class of the 2010 first film is the same, but everything is less spontaneous, a little more forced and a tad overcooked this second time around... Mirren comes out best"
fresh," Perhaps it's a sign, then, of how starved we are for movies with grown-up characters doing grown-up things that it's easy to ignore the downside of Upside and give the film a pass. Allen and Costner should find another movie to make together."
rotten," These characters represent the most repellant clichés of male friendship, where guys can only relate to each other through a discourse of casual misogyny and female conquest."
rotten," We'll forgive England for the Spice Girls. Maybe even Benny Hill, Joan Collins, Boy George, Fergie and that habit of pouring milk in tea. But with Bean's arrival, it might mean war. "
rotten, Adult Beginners feels too stabilized and mild-mannered to warrant more than a sick-day rental.
rotten, Although shot with a modicum of style by a seriously slumming Roland Joffe... nothing terribly thrilling happens in this 'thriller.'
rotten," Full of good intentions and lessons, perhaps this was the reason to its great success as a book, but as a movie it fails entirely. [full review in Spanish]"
rotten, Danny Boyle's hyperactive camera and rude-boy style strain to manipulate us into the emotions the script doesn't honestly earn.
fresh," Set in the same universe as the 2008 monster-focused blockbuster, 10 Cloverfield Lane focuses tightly on a trio of survivors, with solid fear and tension."
fresh, Superb central performances in this tragic drama.
rotten," Painful to watch, but it's nothing an aspirin can't fix. Might as well save yourself the headache, though."
rotten," In an era where films like Sharknado try too hard to be ""so bad it's good"", Need for Speed is needed to show that true awfulness is effortless. "
fresh, The new Planet of the Apes series has been given a fitting and powerful conclusion.
rotten," Compared to its predecessor, Guardians 2 has a hollow emotional core, and the plotting feels clumsy. This movie doesn't have any real purpose, even as a bridge to other chapters in the Marvel story."
fresh, Wall Street in all its naked venality.
rotten, Vanderbilt's screenplay ought to be court-martialed.
fresh," Puts an eerily windswept island location to fine use and features an excellent lead performance from Jessie Buckley, whose open, intelligent face transmits thought and feeling with piercing clarity."
fresh," A stand-up example of how effective underdog sports movies are, no matter how many times you've seen this kind of thing before."
fresh," The Thing passes the reboot/prequel 'blood test' - as in, it's worthy enough to not have to incinerate with a flame-thrower - but, as you'd expect, it's far from an improvement on what has come before."
fresh, Losing a mother can affect the psyche in a particularly primal way... Nanni Moretti's autobiographically inspired Mia Madre captures this dislocation in an intriguing -- though sometimes frustrating -- way.
rotten," Less digital dazzle than deja vu, and inches away from death - literally. And essentially seeing is not believing cartoonish caricatures wrapped in distracting hocus pocus layers of optical illusions, as 'the outside world starts to disappear.' Indeed..."
fresh," An Inconvenient Sequel comes close to sanctifying Gore; while he says he sometimes views the lack of global progress on climate change as ""a personal failure,"" the film never encourages us to agree with him. "
fresh," Ostensibly chronicling a serial killer who murdered women for 25 years in Los Angeles, the film ends up becoming a sad portrait of an African-American community essentially left to fend for itself."
fresh, There's a fine bittersweet air to this tale that leaves you longing to see it again.
fresh," Before it detours into not one, not two, but at least three preposterous Hollywood twists, ""The Water Diviner"" is an absorbing drama."
rotten," ...the film offers not a single shred of anything to separate it from an episode of...well, pick your favorite British spy TV series. "
fresh," It wants to be a claret-stained, muddy nod to the westerns of Anthony Mann and Sam Peckinpah, infused with a Strine sensibility."
rotten," The first encounter among Cooper, McAdams and Stone is so awkward and unsettled that it becomes the movie's own albatross. There are some moments, most of them thanks to McAdams."
rotten," To be sure, this is a rich, multifaceted life, but at just over 100 minutes, Miss Simone? merely scratches the surface, hitting the main talking points without digging deeply enough into any of her different chapters."
rotten," After Earth is the cinematic equivalent of Rebecca Black's ""Friday"" - a parent-funded vanity project gone horribly wrong and thrust out into the world for the rest of us to not enjoy. "
rotten," Martin Scorcese delivers an enormous blowout of a film, a biopic of New York in the 1800s... but it's too much bombast and far too loose."
fresh," 99 Homes pulses with energy from the very beginning. Bahrani is always keeping his camera moving, timed to an unsettling electronic-driven score. It is his most confidently made film."
rotten, A lackluster suspense film without any good qualities. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten," It's filled with plenty of noise and aggressively choppy storytelling, signifying only those things."
rotten," If it weren't for Chow Yun-Fat, Bulletproof Monk would be shooting blanks."
fresh," Disney's multi-Oscar nominated musical is not as good as Mary Poppins to which it's often compared, but Angela Lansbury is well-cast and most of the visual effects, which won the Oscar, are impressive."
fresh, An existential action movie that unashamedly embraces the sensation of awe.
rotten," This could have been a fun, teen Fatal Attraction, but the scorned character's violent rampage is so far-fetched and ugly that it sinks the film and any shot at being a crowd-pleasing popcorn movie."
rotten," Seidl is one of the masters of ""happy-sad"" storytelling. This time, however, his world lacks structural and emotional clarity."
fresh," If you're fond of Sorkin's script flourishes, then Molly's Game is for you."
fresh," It's broad, brash, in your face, inventively shot and, at times, laugh-out-loud funny yet it also becomes a mind-bogglingly extreme Swiftian satire that predicts the Houyhnhnms that our harsh times will create."
rotten," We've seen it all before and seen it done far, far better. E.g., 28 Weeks Later, the Holy Grail of the zombie-contagion genre."
rotten," Ritchie is trying, with mighty self-regard, to give us Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Broadswords. But that just makes it more excruciating, not less."
fresh," Velvet Buzzsaw is a captivating, silly, delicious, decadent mess. It's the cronut of movies, a pointless treat I never thought I'd need, or want, until it was put right in front of me."
fresh," 'Warrior' is secondarily a movie about the world's fastest growing sport, MMA. If you like the fight game, this movie will have you yelling and jumping out of your seat."
fresh," This big-screen adaptation, written and directed by Chbosky, doesn't advance the source material, though it preserves the book's sensitive tone and affectionate characterizations."
fresh," While Spectre may not be the equal of its immediate predecessor, it's still bang on target in delivering what an audience wants from this seemingly indestructible franchise ..."
fresh, A very funny and likeable comedy of manners.
fresh, It doesn't take long for us to get lost in Wiig's thorough portrayal of a dowdy housekeeper who must soldier on in the face of a cruel prank to find some kind of love in her life.
fresh," It's all sweet and agreeable, if no classic. "
fresh," Supernatural violence, sex in art satire/horror hybrid. "
fresh," A shamelessly high-minded, Byron-and-Shelley-quoting existential inquiry into the origin of three species and the nature of belief that goes slumming in genre territory just enough to get itself greenlit."
fresh," Reichardt's beautiful, contemplative movie is aching in the way it evokes loss and the alienation that often comes with adulthood."
rotten," It lives in that kinda-sorta, okay-not-great, this-worked-that-didn't in-between for which words like ""better"" and ""worse"" fall woefully short."
fresh," Okay, I'll say it: If you see only one magic-at-the-turn-of-the-century movie this year, make it this one."
rotten, Offers little that Scorsese doesn't offer with more élan and wit.
fresh," Politics aside, what's patently fascinating about Gitai's films is how his architectural background is reflected in how he structures his work."
rotten," This effort is just too lazy to recommend other than to the hard-core fan. It's absolutely not fabulous for everyone else. (Full Content Review for Parents - Sexual Content, Profanity, Drug Use, etc. - Available)"
fresh," Starting Out in the Evening is thrilling in a way that a movie larded with car chases and explosions can seldom be, because of the way it deals with that basic building block of civilization, the creative process."
rotten," Blessed with considerable virtues, including a clever concept, crackling filmmaking and a charismatic star, it ultimately squanders all of them, undone by an unfortunate lack of subtlety and restraint."
rotten," Eventually, inevitably, [it] goes too far, too fast, and ends up off the rails."
rotten," All the Way tries to delve into that period from the perspective of the D.C. wheeler-dealer at the very top of the power structure, but this historical exploration unfortunately only goes part of the way."
rotten," If you were the kids that the merchandising is aimed at, then you would love this film. It's just not for us."
fresh," A maddening, morbid and marvelous culture clash comedy built around a seriously funny and irritated turn by Matthew Broderick"
rotten, Learning to Drive feels as if it has been manufactured to elicit as much sweetness as possible.
rotten, An earnest biopic that misses the ball. 
fresh, Emilio Portes presents a film about possessions and exorcisms that has narrative solvency and manages to associate the sinister about human behavior with the sinister of the paranormal. [Full Review in Spanish]
fresh," ...a great boxing movie, a great Massachusetts movie, and a great showcase for its lead actors."
rotten, full review at Movies for the Masses
fresh, It's Ball's complex and frank approach to subject matter normally depicted in black-and-white terms that distinguishes Towelhead from so many coming-of-age dramas before it.
fresh, The most entertaining horror movie set in the British Isles since An American Werewolf in London.
rotten," Efron and Devine start out very strong as an anything-for-laughs pairing, but like the movie itself, their connections grows progressively weaker throughout."
rotten," The Quiet Ones is uninspired even by contemporary horror standards - which comes as a bit of a shock, given its pedigree."
fresh," The movie is fun, but not as much fun as it could be because it feels like it's so busy enjoying its own cleverness it doesn't even need an audience."
fresh," A film in which the picket fence is chipped, the wife falls for the black gardener, the husband is drowning his homosexuality in booze, and the two children - well, their lives are about to be shattered to bits."
rotten," By unnecessarily extending the film (and shortening what should have formed its crux), Australia manages the almost unfeasible feat of becoming a less honest film than Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor."
rotten, Tom Green in character turns out to be even less funny than Green being Green.
fresh," A raucous, rambling off-road romp that plays unashamedly broad and loud, ... Adams makes up for a complete disregard for subtlety by delivering a ballsy, sweary celebration of all things alpha-Aussie."
fresh," A craggy, gutbucket epic full of slightly silly, mythopoetic grandeur and a tart taste of regional politics. It's amazing how well some tropes travel."
fresh, More depth than expected and Segel/Blunt are right on target. Not the typical Apatow type production
rotten," I never thought I'd miss the overstuffed craziness of Verbinski's originals - the squiddly extras, the moments of sheer pop surrealism, the Kraken - but ""On Stranger Tides'' is like a familiar house where half the furniture has been sold off."
fresh," A gripping, edge of your seat thriller that's tight and effective in generating the scares by manipulating those old reptilian parts of our brains we still carry around with us. (Full Content Parental Review - Violence, Scares, etc. - also Available)"
rotten, A forced and flaccid affair.
rotten," Yet another valiant but unsuccessful effort to rehabilitate the potency of the musical genre, Honore's Love Songs is a Gallic tweener, neither charming in the academic manner of Jacques Demy 1960s musicals nor immediate enough for contemporary viewers."
rotten," I've seen the future, and all I can say is...go back."
rotten," Imaginative designs, but otherwise a rote CGI blockbuster that takes no chances narratively, cinematically or philosophically."
fresh," What The Unseen lacks is Roeg's economy... The performances are all good though, and the sterile modernity of both the Shields' and Paul's respective domiciles suits these peculiarly alienated people who, unseen, haunt each other's homes."
fresh," If you thought that Mickey Rourke had the market cornered on comebacks with his transcendent performance in Darren Aronofsky's masterpiece The Wrestler, then think again."
rotten, Mismanages its greatest asset: an unusual embarrassment of camp riches.
fresh," The film industry of Laos is still in its infancy, but if Dearest Sister should be taken as a benchmark of expected quality, then it shouldn't be long before the southeast Asian nation makes a mark on the international stage."
fresh, A Christmas Carol is an engaging and relatively dark take on a seasonal classic that finds director Robert Zemeckis refining the performance capture animation technique he used to mixed effect on The Polar Express and Beowulf.
rotten," There is a lot of nasty stuff to look at, but very little that is genuinely haunting, jolting or terrifying."
rotten," As a piece of moviemaking craft, A Serious Man is fascinating; in every other way, it's intolerable."
fresh," A mostly fun partial reset, but this series needs to slip its moorings and make for new horizons."
fresh," It's not just the furniture that creaks, but there are still some effective jolts."
fresh," This is a stylish enough, mind-bending thriller, a cocktail of ""Inception,"" ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" and ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" (the remake)."
rotten," I thought it was just about the worst ... thing I've ever seen. In fact, I was depressed it wasn't laughed off the screen."
rotten, Its twists come off as more absurd than shocking.
fresh," Jonze's inspired evocation of childhood may strike a chord with adults; for younger audience members still living it, the appeal is far from certain."
fresh," Murray playing the glutton doesn't exactly fit the bill and for all the architectural care that's gone into Ember's creation, the secret at its heart is no mystery to us, the audience."
rotten," One presumes that Cameron missed the irony in making a preachy, anti-technology movie using the most technologically advanced tools available."
fresh, Hell hath no fury like a Tarantino heroine scorned.
rotten, So note-perfect are the performances from all the cast in I've Loved You So Long that you want them to inhabit a film that is somehow less contrived and more honest.
fresh," Eventually it spirals into ""gothic horror, except with dinosaurs,"" a concept I personally can get behind."
fresh," The movie labors long, but realistically so, before finding hints of light in a very long tunnel."
fresh," The film works on multiple levels: as a history lesson, as a primer on Middle Eastern politics and as an artist biography."
rotten," For almost the entirety of Order of the Phoenix, we see much the same thing we did in Goblet of Fire."
fresh," For arthouse cinema fans only. No one should wander into this by mistake. Hou Hsiao-hsien's slow, subtle, methodical work is not for mainstream audiences."
rotten," Bond had degenerated into a male model, and something of a genial anachronism."
fresh," ""Three Sisters"" isn't quite as visually spectacular as ""West of the Tracks,"" but it takes advantage of the hillside setting of the village, as well as its morning fog."
rotten," Watchable in its first act but then increasingly dull and overwrought, fudging the idea of whether the audience should get behind its ""redemption-revenge"" motivation."
fresh," Nicolas Cage is as if the question ""Turn down for what?"" took human form and then starred in a bunch of direct-to-DVD thrillers. For him, there is no such thing as a 'phoned-in' performance."
fresh, De Palma continues perfecting his brilliant visual style within the most blatantly artificial plot scenarios.
rotten, Call it Ground Dog Day. Just don't call it good.
rotten," Like watching a cut-rate Roger Corman rip-off of a big Hollywood film, only the tables are ironically turned. The big budget studio version seems pale in comparison."
rotten, Ends up just another dumber than average caper.
rotten," A Dangerous Method is beautifully crafted and abundant with subtext but it's also sterile, dramatically turgid and at times, kind of a drag."
rotten," Não apenas é aborrecido e tolo como ainda conceitualmente feio, glorificando o que há de pior na natureza humana: a guerra, o impulso de destruição e, claro, a iniciativa de transformar jogos de tabuleiro em superproduções hollywoodianas."
fresh, It's good to get your emotions in check before watching the exquisite Inside Out. You're bound to feel the whole bunch watching a child's mind come alive in the most imaginative ways.
rotten," Fictionalized accounts of real tragedy are not impenetrable. James Cameron made us feel for a ship full of characters we'd never met. ""Everest"" can't break that seal, and it's a handicap."
fresh, Brilliantly captures the exhilaration that comes from facing death head-on. It's also an ode to joyous rivalry.
rotten, Screnwriter Doug Jung strings together one recycled plot twist after another in this generic grifter tale.
fresh, It's brutal. It may be 50 years old but it still shocks. 
fresh," It's filled with compelling performances, steeped in lovely photography, paced with grace and, finally, able to convey gravity and moral ambiguity."
rotten, Kevin Costner shines in Mike Binder's disappointingly dull and safe-playing race relations drama.
fresh, Gets by less on what might have been and more on its implicit assurances of what's to come.
fresh, Hollow Man does much more than just peek and grab.
fresh, ...Liar Liar lets Carrey show you the funny...
rotten," Proves, in its tiny way, that no matter how bad the modern romantic comedy has already become, there's still plenty of room for it to get worse. "
fresh," The whole teen angst thing left me cold but I can see where it will appeal to the young, primarily gay, audience it will attract to the art houses."
fresh," ""The Giver"" takes a tortured individual's dilemma and turns it into societal question: If our emotions make us human, but our emotions keep leading us into catastrophe, how much of our essence are we willing to give up just get some peace?"
fresh," An almost experimental discourse on crime, punishment and revenge brilliantly shot by Philip H. Lathrop."
fresh, It's the sort of film that sneaks serious themes and emotions in just when you think it's about to dissolve into farce. Small but largely satisfying.
rotten," Much of the film plays like a static lecture, and a repetitive one as well."
fresh," Eli Roth's sly, shrewd and disquieting Hostel excels at twisting a morbid story around to ask a rather essential, philosophical question: Is violence always a bad thing?"
fresh, Flanagan never overplays his hand with gore or cheap thrills.
rotten, Silly and stale with far too many extraneous characters. Its multiple false endings becoming monotonous far too soon.
rotten," Dumb And Dumberer is like a punch line without a joke - confusing, unfunny, and ultimately worthless."
rotten," It's a frail, anemic trifle, a five-minute sketch inexcusably drawn out to well over an hour and a half."
fresh," Filmed with non-professional actors, with a calculated staging... the film works. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten, This is a film about deeply confused people that seems likely to put viewers in a state of deep confusion for most of its running time.
rotten," For a lesson in how not to make a comic-book movie, look no further than this dull, derivative, sophomorically somber translation of Marvel's cult-hero strip."
rotten, Farrell's one-note performance seems wrong in a film that takes for ever to reach its unedifying conclusion.
fresh, Just try to resist Thor: Ragnarok. We double dog dare you.
rotten," The cinematography's sumptuous, but pacing is very stop-start. Worse, there's an aura of male entitlement, fuelled by the script's uncritical reverence of its flawed philanderers."
rotten, ...all Sturm and no Drang.
rotten, [Leander Paes] is a good actor in a terrible film. Why can't he get better roles?
fresh," Tampopo is one of the great food films, its dizzy deliciousness pre-dating our addiction to the Food Network, celebrity chefs and exquisite plating."
fresh," The first half of the movie is an absorbing study of this part of Nader's public life, and then it switches -- as he did -- to politics, where the results for both him and the picture are less cheerful."
fresh," The acting is strong, with Galifianakis doing an especially good job as the likeable Bobby."
rotten, [The Predator] doesn't explore new territory because the study needs to continue exploiting intellectual property. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten," As a biography, Loving Pablo is fairly standard, save for Bardem's take-down of a performance."
rotten," The problems really begin about halfway through, when you realize that all of this has been done before, and done better."
fresh, Miyazaki's stunning animation and characteristically vivid colors make the film a visual feast...
rotten," Some of the scenes in this gentle romantic pickpocketing yarn are pure cinematic pleasure, but in the end the plot and the characters are too thin to turn a series of delightfully stylised setpieces into a fully satisfying film."
rotten, Mike Judge fans will love it; the rest of us not so much.
rotten," Real no frills filmmaking. Anything that gets in the way of the main idea is stripped to the bone. This includes certain niceties like character, humor, and even story."
fresh, A blockbuster that offers enough quirky pleasures to feel fresh and unpredictable.
rotten, There are some pretty sadistic torture scenes for the gore hounds -- but ultimately this pointless prequel is about as thrilling as a wet towel.
fresh, The best Spider-Man movie to date. 
rotten," The movie seemed to be getting along fine without the melodrama. At times, it seems to be getting along just fine without Carter, but maybe that's just me."
rotten," Are we supposed to be charmed, or shocked, by this? Allen doesn't seem to know."
fresh, The film is not soft on the NFL at all. The way NFL doctors themselves put money above people speaks for itself.
fresh," The Frozen Ground isn't innovative, but it is a well-paced and engaging thriller that has the added appeal of a truth-based narrative."
fresh," The result isn't particularly mesmerizing, but it does offer a well-rounded portrait that will be of particular interest to photography lovers."
rotten," Submergence lives only pending its rigor, its strange and pompous efforts of abstraction. And, of course, it runs out. There is no air left. [Full Review in Spanish] "
fresh, Ably mixes the sensibilities of DreamWorks and Aardman Studios to create a fast-paced comedy likely to appeal to fans of both camps.
fresh, his is a movie that starts with a strong performance by Witherspoon that only gets better through the movie.
fresh, The clever trick of Gifted is that the genius in question is too young to have any idea of the problems she may face.
fresh," Do you have vertigo? Get dizzy easily? No? Good. Then you're in for an amazing, exhilarating climb to the top. "
fresh, [Stern's] goal with the film is not to argue or to condescend but to listen. 
rotten," The best way to characterize the film is to call it juvenile, although one has to wonder what juvenile could dream up something this vile and deranged."
fresh," Whatever may feel annoying or disingenuous about Paddleton is trumped by the emotional honesty of its ending, and the remarkable tenderness of Romano's work."
fresh," Carefully tended facial stubble trimmed to give him a skull-like appearance, Lundgren is truly impressive as a character defined by emotional emptiness."
fresh, The film made me want to be a better person and shows you that life is sometimes about honor and not money.
fresh, A worthy successor to Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense.
fresh, A real treat for Hatchet fans but also an enjoyable (if gory!) horror film in it's own right.
fresh," It's a fast-paced adventure tale like they used to make 'em, a slice of old-fashioned Hollywood that traverses tragedy, romance and exotic travel."
fresh, There are so many ideas sliding into Kelly's swirling vortex of pop culture overload and apocalyptic forecasting that it's understandable not to find coherence in it.
fresh," While there's an abundance of information and stories to be told, Sound City at times becomes almost as idle as its aging idols."
fresh," Vastly diverting documentary about cinema's foremost purveyor of commercial crap, sparked by colorful interviews and a certain element of surprise."
rotten, Blends the premise of TV's Glee with liberal splashes of recent older-skewing audience pleasers Quartet and The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel in predictable fashion.
rotten, Is it too pat to say I Hate This Movie? That's about the level of creative energy Vardalos applies to a film that manages to be every bit as bad as My Life in Ruins.
rotten," Shinbo has a real talent for painting a pretty picture, but the end result of his work can be summed up with one word: flat."
fresh," Machete is the coolest revenge-driven, gore-splattered, star-studded Mexploitation flick ever!"
fresh," Toni Erdmann is seriously funny, yes, but there are also very real emotional stakes behind every joke."
fresh," Enjoyable, but not enough to make me panic."
rotten," It is an allegory about a group of people who survive under great stress, but frankly I would rather have seen them perish than sit through the final three-quarters of the film."
rotten," Funny, that despite non-stop special effects, sorcery and such, The Sorcerer's Apprentice can't quite overcome the key ingredient it lacks: magic."
rotten," Its worst sin is never incompetence, but only a certain airless lack of humor about what it's doing and how."
rotten," As quickly as Parker and Stone win us over with their raunchy wartime send-up, they let victory slip away with one snide, silly, gross scene after another."
fresh, A fizzingly clever big-city satire and deeply strange late noir classic.
rotten," Sophie Lellouche's slick debut is chock-full of Woody-com quotes and references, yet it remains an inconsequential, undernourished trifle that does sod-all with its potential."
fresh," Without meaning to disrespect the die-hard Tolkien fan who views this as overproduced heresy, those looking for a fab romp need look no further than this middle-earth mania."
rotten, It's really just more numbing propaganda.
rotten," Despite flashes of comic inspiration and an abundance of anything-goes boldness, this well-intentioned but wobbly satire is a chaotic free-fire zone."
fresh, A post-punk gem of a drama that seems bent on being both funny and deadly serious.
rotten, ...even if she was guilty Mary Surratt deserves better than this maladroit film that's rife with life-threatening boredom.
rotten, Teen-friendly romance is thoughtful but falls short.
fresh," We're all in search of something, and with a story like Saturday Church, [Damon] Cardasis may just empower someone else can find their way to live courageously, too."
rotten," There's a strange little war movie living inside Leatherheads. What isn't inside is a football film. Not enough of one, anyway. If this were American Idol, Randy Jackson would say it was pitchy and all over the place."
fresh," The Italian Job zooms along with confidence, smarts, and some of the coolest car chases this side of the Indy 500."
fresh," If there's a weakness to the doc, it's that it has a documentary budget, and must make do with a second-tier disco soundtrack, which does a poorer job of capturing the aural atmosphere of the Me Decade's ultimate shrine."
fresh," Stocked to the gills with glorious visuals and delightful whimsy, 'Fish' is a reassuring return to form for director Tim Burton..."
rotten," ""The Lone Ranger"" is a pounding headache of a movie - loud, dumb, overlong and pointless."
rotten, [A] prettily photographed but relationally science-fictional coming-of-age blather.
rotten," ""A Hundred Streets"" seems oddly unequal to the status of its charismatic name cast, headlined by Idris Elba and Gemma Arterton."
rotten," Henry Cavill won the evolutionary sweepstakes and even without being Ritchie's object of desire, he's the best thing in the movie. Everything else is boring, stunted and a ""who cares""?"
fresh," The dramatic scenes are hotchpotch. But when the action turns on, it grips you and it keeps on the edge of your seat."
fresh," Decent, but not great."
rotten, Ultimately the film fails to make us feel invested in what's going on in the story. 
fresh," Thankfully an increase in both star wattage and finances has not distracted the brothers one single bit, their darkly acerbic comedy one of the better %u2013 and funnier %u2013 motion pictures I've had the delight to view this year."
fresh," To its credit, it's one of precious few US releases this year to deliver almost exactly on what its lip-smacking title promises."
rotten," Antonia is obviously our point person here, but she's such a sour pickle that you never get to ease into her story."
fresh," 'I've had no issues in working with the Weinsteins. They're ma boyz!,' Tarantino exclaimed in our Chicago interview both with anticipated media training but also with genuine indebtedness to the brotherly duo. 'They're coming back in a big way.'"
fresh, [A] ceaselessly entertaining action comedy from Korean writer-director Kim Seong-hun.
fresh," The Edge of Seventeen is its own animal, powered by a perceptive and wryly funny take on things by Craig - who also makes her directing debut - and highlighted by the performance of a never-better Steinfeld."
rotten, The cinematic equivalent of an investigative Sports Illustrated two-parter.
rotten," [Paul] Weitz co-directed the wonderful About a Boy in 2002, but in Dreamz -- a tediously facile satire -- his comic instincts fail him."
fresh," A great sequel feels fresh and familiar all at the same time, which is why 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' is a great sequel."
fresh," Whereas other pictures of this type tend to focus on the thrills, this one focuses on the idea that lives are at stake. The Finest Hours' appreciation of the ""leave no man behind"" ethic is refreshing."
fresh," There are no real villains here, just normal people making their way through life. And Bliss, while willful, is not horrible; she's just found something she needs to do, fishnets and all, and she's doing it."
rotten," Jurassic World is a massive disappointment with a multitude of flaws, from the retreaded story and endless, monotonous action sequences, to the flat, lifeless characters and the uninspired CGI dinosaurs."
rotten," For all its positives, Talvar fails to keep that distance, and therefore compromises its ability to be an impartial, unbiased chronicle of what is India's most sensational murder case."
fresh," Chess is not the most visual of games, but Nair makes these competitions come alive. She also gets the most out of her mostly nonprofessional African cast, not to mention her two stars, Oyelowo and Nyong'o."
rotten, Quarantine is a one-note nightmare.
rotten," The film gets one star from me for the admirable brevity of its running time and another for the definite article in its title, seemingly an implicit promise that there will be no sequel."
rotten, Mostly comes across like an extended episode of 'Lifestyles of the Rich and Fatuous.'
fresh, O terceiro ato da obra máxima do Cinema.
fresh," Director Chris Noonan ('Babe') gives us a story with the right balance of humor, pathos and romance."
rotten," Though playful and occasionally bright, the high concept's never taken into the deep end of the imagination pool to leave a mark."
fresh," A movie of formidable intelligence and observation, marbled with moments of magical abstraction."
rotten, What happens when you take 3 of the best dramatic actresses of all time and put them together in a road movie? Pretty much a movie that should have wound up on Lifetime.
fresh," Million Dollar Baby provides a suitably rough-hewn canvas on which Eastwood can practice his spartan, highly personal brand of storytelling, and he puts his stamp indelibly on it as producer, director, star and composer."
rotten," The movie has an odd feeling, both lush and listless. It's enough to make us believe Allen's comic batteries need recharging."
rotten," ""This Is 40"" tends to be about the self-inflicted problems of spoiled upper-middle class white people. Which can be sort of funny, sure. Sort of."
rotten," Being an urban dance movie, guns make their appearance, along with every stereotype about hip-hop or the young. Don't believe the hype. Just watch them dance."
fresh, A splendid and sombre dissection of the corrupt behavior of human being. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten," Danny Strong's film suggests dramatic Tetris, and it leeches J.D. Salinger and his process of any mystery."
fresh," The Girl with All the Gifts, puts the audience back in touch with the scariest thing about zombies-that they are not monsters at all, just human beings altered by the unstoppable tide of nature's will. "
rotten," If you don't think too hard about why Neeson gets brought in or how the baddies operate or what the point is, you may be able to enjoy yourself. At least until the final act, when the film goes off the rails. Like a train might do. "
rotten," Come on! Look at the title, for heaven's sake! Were you expecting it to be good? What were you expecting?"
fresh," ""The insult shows enough sensitivity and intelligence so the cinephile can finish the movie, like his stubborn protagonists, with a minimum smile of understanding and complicity""."
rotten," Brings back the same cast of characters to do more or less exactly what they did in the previous films, only this time in sets with more sci-fi gloss than postapocalyptic grunge."
rotten," Carrey runs riot, and Stiller won't stop him."
rotten," This atavistic Christians-vs-Moors narrative doesn't belong in the present day, and that's no doubt why so many people are addicted to it: it's so ideologically overstated that it can easily be brushed off as harmlessly quaint escapism."
fresh," Thank You For Your Service is a wholeheartedly commendable endeavor. Not just because of its weighty subject matter, which sees it examine PTSD and the lack of options provided to veterans."
rotten, Plays like the product of a Woody tribute act that couldn't decide if it preferred Annie Hall or Crimes and Misdemeanors.
fresh," ""Destroyer"" doesn't deserve a parade for originality, but Kusama's firm commitment to the revenge movie cause is electrifying."
rotten, I counted six laughs and three walk-outs.
rotten," A bloodless and deathly dull portrait of a sweet, albeit damaged, young woman mired in the mundanities of prep-school life."
rotten," Half-aware it's an action flick while trying to breezily amuse, and half-alert to its comic potential while roaring off on a chase or shoot-out, it staggers along. Knight and Day's potential vanishes in the haze of a mundane situation-comedy."
rotten," Isla Fisher does her best with a shopworn, shopped out premise."
fresh, Wildly original and entertaining.
rotten," Unless you have an incurable case of Anglophilia, save your hard-earned moneypenny for the DVD rental."
rotten, Christensen and most of the young men are barely there.
rotten," All the squealing tires, flying bullets and falling bodies cannot save Heat from drowning in its own banalities."
rotten, But this is more than just an irritating movie; it's a disappointing one.
rotten," Many will [...] praise [Toni] Collette's unflinching lack of vanity and honesty in this portrayal, but I found her performance predictable."
fresh," I Am Jane Doe doesn't quite work in some places, but it's a significant film deserving global recognition - if only to bring attention to the realities of child trafficking."
fresh, There's a gossipy fascination to it.
rotten," While the effort can be appreciated, the vehicle was running on fumes from the start."
rotten, [...]they have about as much chemistry as John Hinckley and Jodie Foster
fresh, [A] confrontation with evil that isn't quite like anything we've seen on film before...
rotten, After a while you find yourself giggling uncontrollably as Paltrow lurches through her scenes.
rotten, It is really boring.
rotten," The real problem with the movie is simple - it's just not funny enough, and too worried about making McCarthy's usual hilarious supporting character into a woman sympathetic enough (that is, bland enough) to be the heroine."
rotten," Instead of long takes, which are lovingly utilized in Step Up 3D, Jon M. Chu opts for increasing volatility in the editing room."
rotten," The movie goes from breezy and sporadically funny to plodding and dour, and even Portman's performance loses a bit of its spark."
rotten," Still, if you love carnage, gooey flesh, and dead vamps ... you'll have a fine time."
fresh," Snowpiercer features uneven performances, but gets great mileage from its set design, the sheer audacity of the premise, and the appearance of one of those movie villains who seem able to take lethal punishment without actually dying."
fresh," The film will restore one's faith in humanity, at least during its running time."
fresh, A brilliant film that merits inclusion in every self-respecting film critic's top three.
rotten, That disgusting wet noise is an audience of eyes rolling skyward in unison.
rotten, It's not just graphic; it's contemptuous.
fresh, This is really cool!
rotten," Capable as the entire cast is, however, their collective efforts ultimately sputter out against Hostiles' overwhelming, near-airless aura of Importance."
rotten, The cinematic equivalent of a third-generation photocopy of a doodle barely worth a glance in the first place.
fresh, I fully expected it to be dumbed down beyond all recognition. I expected Dangerous Liaisons 90210. But I can admit when I'm wrong.
fresh," Fortunately, a smart script and great set pieces make this tale of Soviet spies, weird artifacts and a lost city a worthy capstone to the series."
rotten," Once Hollywood gets its rabid fangs into a complex book, it often turns it into a shambling, snarling parody of itself."
rotten, Run a mile in any direction from Dragonball Evolution.
rotten," Allen the writer-director has gone tone-deaf this time around, somehow not realizing that the nonstop prattling of the less than scintillating characters almost never rings true."
fresh," When Murrow cautions viewers they should 'not be driven by fear into an age of unreason,' the film seems more culturally relevant than anything playing at the multiplex."
fresh," The story is a bit tangled, and there is too much of it packed into nearly 80 minutes, but little kids won't be bothered when the animation is so magical."
fresh, Heaven Knows What ... is almost entirely propelled by the ebb and flow of its characters' ferocious desires.
fresh," It's pretty watchable, mainly thanks to strong performances from Kinnear and Coleman. Cyrus, sadly, fails to convey a broken heart."
rotten, A messy patchwork of ideas spinning off every which way...but failing to be good doesn't mean that it's not interesting.
rotten, It is a film where art direction triumphs but genuine art remains elusive.
rotten, Rings inauthentic throughout.
rotten, There's so much exposition that we pause near the climax for a bunch of dialogue just to get through it.
rotten," Besides repeating his premise that only fools fall in love and deserve whatever circle of hell they enter for it, [LaBute] seems to really believe that morality has no place in art. Certainly, he's keeping it out of his."
rotten," That this comes via minimal special effects is admirable, but the movie also cheats a bit: Tinkly piano music is layered onto the spooky moments, which kills the faux-doc ""realism."
fresh," At the beginning of Spotlight, a title card proclaims ""based on actual events,"" a tactic many films use to manufacture authenticity even if it's never earned. Here, it feels absolutely right."
rotten," Ao menos, a versão de Corman se assumia como lixo."
rotten," That scratching sound you hear isn't Baloo the bear rubbing against a tree, it's Disney scraping the bottom of the sequel barrel with a follow-up that has none of the charm or creativity of the original."
rotten," At last, after The Lovely Bones and Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, we receive the third part in a reprehensible triple feature of revoltingly smarmy and overstylized tragedies about precocious children and grief."
fresh," A revelation when it allows us to see what people surrender for art, as well as why people surrender their art."
fresh," An offbeat collage of animation, dramatization and documentary that's a banquet of sweet-and-sour wit and grudging humanism."
rotten," Garrel and his screenwriter, the legendary Jean-Claude Carriere manage to cram a lot of philosophical ideas and concepts into the short running time, but I found myself caring less about them."
fresh," As Folman makes peace with his past, he also makes a strong argument against war. Waltz with Bashir is a haunted and haunting film, one that resonates long after the final fadeout."
fresh," There's a lot to like in Gonjiam. I only wish the director had trusted himself more to take the horror road not taken. The result would have been something new, and fresh in a genre in which unconventional ideas are regularly rewarded."
fresh," It's sensitively written, humorously human, warmly acted, and admirably resistant to most of the obvious drag-queen cliches."
fresh," In the parlance of American Bandstand it's got a good beat and you can dance to it, but that hardly separates it from the rest of the pack."
fresh, Life on the Road was a poignant look into a character I never dreamed could be this interesting. 
rotten," We now have an official subgenre in which a woman is initially presented as unattractive; is concussed into a fantasy in which she becomes impossibly desirable; and from the experience gleans important, affirmative lessons about believing in herself."
fresh," Youngsters (anyone up to about 24) will whisper 'cool' with jaws dropped every 85 seconds or so, as the gizmos, gadgets, weapons and other toys of the future flash before their eyes"
rotten," Undermining the entire snooze-fest is Lee and Schamus's sentimental, clichéd view of Woodstock as the last flowering of hippie innocence."
fresh," Vacth creates an empathetic, yet unreadable protagonist on a journey where delusions frequently overpower reality."
rotten," The ideas behind Meet The Fockers are the best part of this zany sequel to Meet The Parents, but getting Fockerised is not as funny as it should be."
fresh," The jokes are never-ending and multilayered, calculated so that adults do not get bored -- which is important, because they buy the tickets. It's all bolted together with precision and good humour, although not much whimsy."
rotten, Probably the vilest waste of 2 hours of my life.
fresh, Here in a single film is a snapshot of how we live our lives circa 2014 in the technology-dominated digital age
rotten, Mr. Helgeland's ponderously reverential biopic is a string of unearned runs.
fresh, It's a morass of individually satisfying ideas that fail to create a larger picture.
rotten, Predictably unsatisfying and so banal that it's a total turnoff.
fresh," Rock crumbles, wood splinters, and cartoon sound effects yelp in Chow's full-bore looney tune."
rotten," Ultimately, Oblivion is aptly named - no other movie so far this year has been so instantly forgettable."
rotten," Shooting a chaotic action scene in an extra dimension definitely adds to the clutter, but does zilch to subtract from the tedium."
fresh," It's the questions that ultimately keep Unknown afloat, regardless of how silly the answers might be."
rotten," There may be no words within ""Samsara,"" a visually startling work of global cinematography. But there is a narrative, one by which the movie undermines itself."
fresh," Until the special effects take over in the final act, this is an unusually gritty, grounded superhero thriller, with characters who are so believable that the wacky science almost seems to make sense."
fresh," When the movie works, it can derive some raucous laughter..."
fresh," Pure, unadulterated teen exploitation filmmaking at its best."
fresh," An exquisite, humanistic and subtly topical work of cinema art that manages to keep the intimate, revelatory sensibility of a one-man play intact while fleshing out the characters and creating a very realistic and richly detailed school community."
rotten," ""Vacation"" is, minute to minute, one of the most repellent, mean-spirited gross-out comedies it's ever been my squirmy displeasure to sit through."
fresh," David Cronenberg's focus remains, as always, on issues of mind/body invasion, corruption, and rebirth."
fresh, Its unusual ambition and thoughtfulness make it resonate a bit more than most slick studio action fare.
fresh, A fitfully funny if somewhat less excellent sequel.
fresh," ""Manglehorn"" feel like a bigger film than its logline suggests, but it is not the kind of big that sprawls. Instead it dives straight down to lower reaches of a complicated man, down to the darkest waters that can contain both monsters and magic."
fresh," Moore packs the performance with so much insight that Georgette becomes the real star of the story, the centre of the triangle with Maggie and John revolving around her."
rotten," Her Alibi is a trifling confection, a near-invisible farce, cinematic pocket lint. That's not to say that it's a terrible movie; cake icing certainly isn't a terrible food."
fresh," Jackson's audacity and folly both come to the fore in this picture, which is much more than a placeholder but something less than a fully satisfying saga in its own right."
rotten," It's slickly executed, handsomely acted for the most part and utterly easy to forget."
fresh," Watching Tom Hardy act in this film is, in a word, exhilarating."
fresh, [Condon and Rosenberg] deviate from the original story created by Stephenie Meyer in a way that feels like a dance in the end zone.
rotten," 'No One Lives' is generic ""shock"" cinema that was a result of 'Hostel,' which is why it feels like it sets horror back 10 years."
rotten," Try as you might to magic up Bill Bixby from the 70s' TV series The Magician, it just ain't going to happen."
rotten, Not quite as bad as I thought it was going to be. The original was downright awful.
rotten," ( ... ) whimsical to the point of being an itch you can't scratch. When one of Britain's most successful stars tries to say with a perfectly straight face,""I'm not rich and I'm not important,"" you'll find it impossible to believe him!"
rotten," Slick and action-packed, but painfully insipid, needlessly gory, lackluster and, worst of all, fails to maintain its excitement, cleverness, imagination and thrills."
fresh, There's a great deal of effort involved in making this film and I am full of admiration - even if not especially keen to see it again
rotten," The idea is designed to make us derive gleeful parallels from the film's awkwardness, reveling in the lighter side of marital discord. Ironically, it is their authenticity as a couple that makes it impossible to shrug off a fatal bout of bizarre writing."
rotten, The movie's soundtrack and colorful cinematography can't smooth-talk itself past a mess of cultural insensitivities.
fresh," With its lack of a big-name cast, and the Strause brothers' proven willingness to embrace bleakness, ...Skyline holds out - and then fulfils - its promise of anything goes, from the mesmerising intro to the bitter, bananas end."
rotten," Despite its promise, there is nothing modern about 3 Generations and its approach to trans representation."
rotten," Results wants to seduce and charm by roughing up the rom-com formula but, way too often, it drags and annoys."
rotten, Cinematic smugness has a fatal impact on the delineation of Wiesler's quietly heroic political calisthenics and The Lives of Others' supposedly uplifting denouement.
fresh," If it tried to do anything more, it would fail and perhaps explode, but at this level of manic whimsy, it is just about right."
fresh, Curtis is so heartbreakingly convincing in the lead role that he routinely frees you of the feeling you're watching one more adversity saga with scrappy kids and a third-act tournament.
fresh," Once - and if - you accept that this is a B-movie plot, it is possible to find a level of enjoyment from its undeniably A-movie trappings."
fresh, Dead Ringers it ain't. But it is the Farrelly brothers doing what they do best: taking a hot-button topic and jamming it with as much humor as they can.
fresh, Celeste & Jesse Forever is far funnier than you'd expect a film about a tortuous split to be -- and more deft and melancholy than any other comedy I can recall that co-stars a six-foot bong and a tub of Cheese Balls.
fresh," Kids aren't dumb. They have opinions, hopes and dreams that deserve to be recognized and exercised, and cinema should be an engaging experience full of power and potential - not a babysitter. 'Holes' is not a babysitter."
fresh, Allen uses the change of scenery to his advantage.
rotten, What is the point of a musician biopic if you don't get to hear the soundtrack to their life?
rotten," Too scary, too gory, too gross."
fresh," The film rattles along nicely towards its inventive final stand-off, which once again makes the most of the relatively limited resources through ingenious use of some chains, an aeroplane wing and basic physics."
fresh," The actresses bring warmth and complexity to their stock roles, magnifying class struggle through their intriguing back-and-forths."
fresh, A cute walk through history with an unwilling history-maker.
fresh," It's an important subject given a realistic, respectful treatment without diminishing the cruelty and the inhumane nature of institutionalized slavery."
fresh," Willis and Def are wonderful...Donner (Lethal Weapon) unleashes a tight, effective yarn"
fresh, A smart script and vivid characters make this rowdy hockey comedy much more engaging than we expect.
fresh, This is a slow burning film that takes a while to get going but ultimately packs a bigger punch than you'd expect.
rotten, You can hold off beating a path to The Spy Who Dumped Me as it's no McKinnon must-see - but she's still the best of the fun in this ho-hum action caper.
fresh, A sweet underdog story.
fresh," Unlike a conventional biopic like ""The Imitation Game"" that attempts to draw clear cause-and-effect between one event and the next, Leigh refuses to explain or judge his subject. The ""Mr."" in title suggests the respectful distance he keeps."
fresh, Charlotte Gainsborough's performance is absolutely mesmerizing...
rotten," A non-movie that whisks its premise by you with a perfunctoriness that suggests you've been standing in line with cranky kids for an hour in the hot Florida sun, so let's get to it. Even in the era of short attention spans, it is slight."
fresh," Role Models crosses plenty of familiar territory, but Wain and his merry band of mischief-makers offer a likeable, laughable mix of testosterone and heart."
fresh," Of the major stars, it's Macy, not surprisingly, who offers the most texture, soul and self-deprecating humor in this light but appealing comedy."
rotten," By largely ignoring public transit to focus on personal transportation, Gertten mis-frames his movie as a zero-sum argument."
fresh," 24 Frames is a classically Kiarostami work, indicative of his life's curiosities and trademark inquiries, but far short of a culminating utterance."
rotten," Seriously, this sounds like The Young and the Restless."
fresh," ""RED 2"" stands quite sturdily on its own as a caper comedy whose stars just happen to be approaching 50, 60 and even 70 years old."
fresh," The film has the perfect mix of fun, action and poignant moments that, without being too deep, are able to touch sensitive fibers and generate strong empathy with the characters. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten," This suspense film by first-time writer-director Bryan Bertino initially squeezes some surprisingly effective scares out of familiar elements. Sadly, the scenario quickly becomes attenuated and unbelievable."
rotten," At the very end, in the big climax, is where it actually says what it has to say. And It's pretty sophomoric what it has to say."
rotten," Among movies that are intended to be spiritually insightful, this is one of the most hollow and disappointing that I've seen, a surface-level rendering of platitudinous feel-good hooey. "
fresh," Sumptuous, overheated, and ridiculous, Love is a visual delight -- the opening montage of a snowy Milan alone make it worthwhile"
fresh," A mostly entertaining adventure that plays like ""Lord of the Flies"" meets ""Cube"" meets an intelligent design lecture."
fresh, Stunning mountain vistas and first-rate performances... make The Mustang worth the ride.
rotten," Nem mesmo a bela fotografia e a impecável direção de arte conseguem salvar esta bagunça narrativa que, sob a desculpa de promover uma discussão metafísica, faz Coppola parecer um cineasta em início de carreira."
rotten," If the blogosphere makes hay from the fact that Radcliffe goes beyond first base in this film, the robotic storytelling will deflate any curiosity."
rotten, ...an overpriced Kenneth Cole timepiece built with tween bromides.
rotten, Leviathan is about as pointless and frustrating a cinematic experience as one can easily recall. 
rotten, Neither as original as Ratatouille nor as funny as Shrek.
fresh," A lucky, witty and hilarious film that finds its main merit in the point of view of its protagonists: The Yetis. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten," A hackneyed, fluffy, formulaic chick flick with fangs."
fresh," It should have been titled Run, Jaguar, Run. Try to forget Gibson's spiritual intent, shallow text (and bad conduct) and watch it as the most thrilling and longest chase actioner Hollywood made this year, putting to shame genre ""experts"" like Michael Bay"
fresh, Few directors in world cinema are working so competently and consistently in any mode as Chow is in this one.
fresh," If you're looking for a film that celebrates the holiday spirit, This Christmas would be my first suggestion because it's heartfelt and not too sweet."
fresh," DEMON is a prodigious story, one that terrifies and resonates and remains."
fresh," Skate Kitchen exists in a time when it's still not normalized for men to see women on skateboards, but the crystal clear coolness of Moselle's film proves they should get with the program."
fresh," If it falls short of its ambitions, you have to love that it tries to go for the big story, and that it gives Elle Fanning such a grand role at her tender age."
rotten," Burke and Hare is timid and dithering and blandly bad, and the new Ealing Studios seems unworthy of its inheritance, and it's all just a damn shame."
rotten," The 1970s-style special effects do little to distract us from an uneven script, direction and performances. Yet there's enough here for us to hope it'll come together."
rotten, Once Koler's charm begins to wear thin it's easy to become frustrated by a story that has the potential to be so much more than a light romantic frolic.
rotten," It might have 12 in its title, but make no mistake, the low-rent military drama ""12 Strong"" is a one-man show for Chris Hemsworth. "
fresh," Fortunately, there are now enough real people fighting back that Moore can focus on them instead of his own schtick."
rotten, Dark Shadows gets stuck in neutral because of the uncertainty as to what kind of a film it wants to be.
fresh," Anchored by Andrew Garfield's heartfelt performance as the lovably nerdy Peter Parker, this ""Spider-Man"" may not be amazing, but it's certainly good enough."
fresh," If Brad's emotional status were a work of art, it would look a lot like an Edvard Munch scream, or maybe a dark little corner of Dante's Inferno."
fresh," Ultimately, and thankfully, it's saved by its stars, who carry it all to safety as often as they can."
rotten," The finale of the film is satisfying in the extreme, as primal and exacting as we wish the film entire would have been."
fresh," Rarely serious yet not expressly a comedy, Pirates successfully replicates the hammy cinematics of a Disney theme-park ride."
rotten," So, it starts with the decapitation of a live giraffe. And, it goes downhill from there."
fresh," Wenham's wry, understated delivery is hard to resist and he's quite believable as a certain type of Australian male artist, all sheepish good looks, amiable stubbornness and unrepentant self-absorption."
rotten, The film is likeable but nowhere near as sharp or as funny as you hope it is going to be.
fresh," What could have been, in lesser hands, a cheap and heartless real estate smackdown is instead a somber, intriguing and morally juicy drama for most of its running time."
fresh," You don't have to be a Sandler fan: if vulgarity mixed with a little sentiment is your thing, you've come to the right place."
fresh," [Malick's] characters must consider their lives, consider each other, and resolve the situation like adults. And when they do, a story that seemed to be irredeemably broken snaps back together."
fresh, ...an admittedly overlong yet thoroughly engaging effort that brings a fresh spin to the old fish-out-of-water formula.
rotten," If ever there were a typical January movie, it's Contraband, a film so dreary (and downright distasteful) that no studio would think of releasing it in December, when all eyes are focused on quality."
fresh," Aside from the 3D animation looking fantastic and the film having a dark, complex feel to it that makes it feel more grown up, the primary reason worth watching is Andrew Garfield."
rotten," For a movie that's allegedly a comedy, it never feels like it's having fun."
rotten," Little effort is made to evoke the seriousness of humanity's predicament, the farm skills of the drones are left sketchy, and in the end, the menace posed by the story's villains does not make much logical sense."
fresh, What is most fresh but coherent is [director Richard] Eyre's interpretation of the three sisters as women absolutely at the end of their tether.
fresh, Todd Haynes establishes a parallel narrative dissociated by half a century... [Full review in Spanish]
rotten, There are enough pieces of this story missing or detached from context that hockey here does start to become the kind of metaphor that the movie seems to want to avoid.
fresh," This is the first produced script from the writers and they find more flexibility in this story than I expected. There is space for depth, drama and real life."
rotten," Dogs and cats are far funnier and more engaging when they behave like, well, dogs and cats."
rotten," Unfortunately, thanks to a lazy and often absurd script - an angry alligator also makes an appearance at one point - whatever vision birthed this sequel just doesn't add up."
rotten," [The] plot would make even the lightweight storylines of ""That's So Raven"" seem literary. It would make the lightweight storylines of a Bazooka Joe comic strip seem literary."
fresh," Neither raunchy nor crude nor ADD-addled, the movie prefers long, elaborate, often very funny gags punctuated by bursts of good-natured verbal silliness."
fresh," ...a deft blending of comedy and drama. It may not be the most credible film of the year, but I found it diverting and enjoyable."
fresh, This movie blew me away.
fresh," Part serial-killer policier, part Body Snatchers science fiction, this ferociously entertaining hybrid marks the most welcome arrival of South Korean filmmaker Jang Joon-Hwan into a tired, been-there/done-that genre scene."
fresh, Writer Scott Silver and director Curtis Hanson dig deep into the subculture to deliver a terrific movie.
rotten, No review could really do justice to the monumental trashiness of this mess; it really has to be seen to be believed.
fresh, A solid vehicle for Elizabeth Banks to show off her comedic chops
rotten," The movie clicks along pretty well until they launch their elaborate plot against the merchants of death, which seems to go on forever."
fresh, He Named Me Malala is much more effective than any essay or political speech on the destructive nature of what the Taliban is attempting to do. 
fresh, Should not only entertain but make your hair stand up.
rotten," Watching this movie, you get the feeling that the Depression existed so that Seabiscuit could be memorialized."
rotten," Much like its frazzled protagonist, 6 Balloons has a strong sense of direction, but the film is too constricted to let go, embrace the detours, and allow life to takes it course."
rotten," It's pacy all right, but glib and uninvolving for grown-ups, though perhaps furnished with enough in the way of spaceships, lasers and digital explosions to pacify undemanding little 'uns of an afternoon."
fresh," While it's probably not the high level prestige project everyone involved hoped it would be, The Front Runner still has a lot to like within its standard construction. "
rotten," Ultimately, this is a particularly pointless and badly made remake that fails to improve on either District 13 or its 2009 sequel."
fresh," True, The Little Hours is essentially a one-joke comedy - but most of the jokes under the umbrellas of that one joke are pretty damn, I mean darn, funny."
fresh," If there's such a thing as anthropological poetry, this is it."
fresh, The director explores all three sides of his story with a sensitivity and an inquisitiveness reminiscent of Truffaut.
rotten," ironically, McKay's kaleidoscopic approach has the effect of shoving Cheney's horrors safely into the past."
fresh," If you love cinema, then you must love Ingmar Bergman, and this documentary will justify your love. "
fresh," Filled with observant, atmosphere-drenched, folkloric vignettes that delineate racism in that time in that place."
fresh," Una forma esquizofrénica de comprender el mundo, de describir el amor, y de narrar las ideas básicas que nos definen como seres humanos..."
rotten, Plays like a fairly standard teen drama with a surprisingly unpleasant sting in the tale.
fresh," It seems brave, in its restrained fashion, and when Cox is on-screen you feel it's getting close to some uncomfortable truth."
rotten," Fool's Gold can't help but feel like one of the larger disappointments found in this new year of filmgoing. I mean, how often does a seafaring actioner come along, and then the guy hired to direct it is Andy Tennant?"
fresh," The Coens adhere much closer to Portis' novel than the 1969 adaptation did, relishing the era-appropriate  language as if it were their own tongue and imbuing the proceedings with a romantic, ultimately melancholy sense of adventure."
fresh, This film isn't out to win over the Internet fanboy audience. I'ts not out to find new supporters in the New York art houses. It's all about giving the fans what they want.
fresh," For all its reliance on sports movie clichés, Fighting with My Family still manages to be fresh and original where it truly counts, and for a lot of viewers, that's going to make this one a real knockout."
fresh," Layer Cake has sizzle, but it also offers plenty of steak."
rotten," Poor Cuba Gooding. As if it were not humiliating enough to play a guy so clumsy that he can't walk in the snow without pratfalling, he also has to do jokes about being a black man in the Great White North."
fresh," Orlowski's soulful direction, coupled with Balog's evocative eye, predictably leads to a number of awe-inspiring juxtapositions, best sampled on the big screen. "
fresh," Against a backdrop of candlelit conversation and barnyard carnality, Serra sets in motion contrasting ideas about pleasure and desire, alternating between winding philosophical dialogue and wordless passages of savage beauty."
fresh, The visuals are stunning and the stunts stunning.
fresh, Sandler can still do it when it comes to silly.
rotten," Has a certain hokey, old-fashioned charm but otherwise proves pretty bland in today's horror climate."
fresh, A couple's new marriage is tested on a visit to the groom's family in North Carolina where traditional values hold sway.
rotten," For much of its runtime, the film is simply there, decent for the most part, but at no point immersive. "
fresh," A useful primer, though it also focuses a bit more on the activism than on the art."
rotten, It's all so neatly laid out yet so lacking in the type of detail that would give it emotional soul. Even the dog Stacie so yearns for and gets with Laurel goes MIA once it's served its purpose.
rotten," Chances are you'll be wishing our heroine would just make up her mind, so the rest of us can go home long before the resolution."
fresh," Writer-director Cristian Mungiu continues his expert evisceration of his native Romania, and by extension, this whole rotten world and the people who make it that way, even as they convince themselves otherwise."
rotten," Watching ""Gangster Squad"" is like being caught in the middle of a mob war between historical inaccuracy and bad taste."
rotten, It's too high-minded to offer the cheap comforts of genre but too low-minded to skip one last chance to ogle the kind of woman viewers might have a crush on in real life.
rotten," It's essentially a series of black-out scenes tracing the lives of young activists who grow and change before our eyes. And while filmmaker Assayas and his fine cast convey that beautifully, they never properly engage us."
rotten," Grotesquely sentimental, shamelessly manipulative and fundamentally bad."
fresh," A fitfully hilarious comedy sequel from Seth Rogen, the kind of man who can get away with pointing at a pregnant Hasidic woman and saying: ""Look, another little Jew in the oven!"""
fresh," A typically wrenching film for Farhadi, one that morphs from a quiet family drama to a tale of revenge, and is all the more impressive for how seamlessly it executes that shift."
fresh," Expressing much while often saying little, Jones proves once again to be a mesmerising screen presence, a performer behind whose face you can see the most complex and subtle thought processes at work."
rotten," Sometimes, transgressive loves turn into boring messes. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten," Both crushingly pretentious and oddly silly--rather like the cinematic equivalent of Jack Handey's 'Deep Thoughts,' but without the saving grace of intentional humor."
rotten," Imagine an Elmore Leonard movie scripted by a bad Nora Ephron imitator, and you'll have an idea of how dead-in-the-Jersey-water it is."
rotten," Elizabeth: The Golden Age places its gilded head upon the chopping block right from the opening salvo, replacing its predecessor's cunning with bombast."
rotten," The problem for The Intervention lies in its misjudgment of tone. It's played for feelgood laughs (the cornball ending feels especially unearned), when DuVall should have instead dug deeper to exploit her characters for the messed up people that they are."
fresh, On the whole this is surprisingly cautious and sad.
rotten," Quite harrowing, but a bit obvious and right-on-the-edge-of racist."
rotten," It might be too much to ask for a little more diversity in the movie's subjects. Aren't there any boring, conventionally innocent kids marching in God's army?"
rotten, After 30 minutes you start to hanker for Wallace and Gromit.
fresh," The Guardians of the Galaxy movies are allowed to simply be movies rather than bridges to other, future Marvel franchises. It frees them up to be fun."
rotten, Hess ... exhibits misplaced pride in her own mediocre screenplay and too little sense and sensibility.
rotten," Abrams' muddled tribute to '80s Spielberg does indeed feature well-rounded human beings, but mostly forgets to put them in an interesting story."
rotten," The film struggles to find a consistent tone between its attempts at broad stoner comedy, fractured family quirks and a more serious examination of mental illness."
rotten," The ending is awful. It's so silly, and unnecessary."
fresh, Director Luis Buñuel would be proud of the scabrous scene in which the Davison clan sits down to supper and the civilized bourgeois meal turns to rot before our eyes.
rotten, What's next: a Family Circus movie? Where o where is the hero who will save us?
rotten," The mop is miraculous. David O. Russell's latest movie, not so much."
fresh," While it certainly takes its time to arrive at a destination of fate, The Argentine is worth the energy invested."
rotten," This one hangs on the notion of fate, and once you've figured out whose fate is the central issue, the outcome -- even with those clumsy plot twists -- is fairly predictable."
fresh," However, the excellent performances count for a great deal, and the conversations are exceedingly intelligent, offering up provocative arguments on sex, the ego, and the concept of destiny."
rotten, The emotional underpinnings and psychological depths of great detective fiction get tossed aside for a wallow in stylistic excess.
rotten, Schwarzenegger's return to his most iconic role provides much of the appeal of this otherwise purposeless redo.
fresh, ...captures what nature might look like through Goodall's eyes.
fresh," Though Mann and Perry are game, it's Efron who carries the movie."
rotten, Lacks the flair of its literary predecessor.
rotten," ""Runner Runner"" is the kind of meat-and-potatoes genre picture that might be passable if the people involved in making it had given the same thought and concentration to the development of the plot and the ending as they did to the fairly involving set-up."
fresh, An ambitious and sporadically electrifying drama...
fresh," Weinstein and Taylor keep things traditional when it comes to the [documentary] format, which lets viewers feel as though they're simply gathering 'round the fireplace for story time."
fresh, ...a quirky coming-of-age story (is there any other kind these days?) full of wry Wes Anderson-style humor and maladjusted misfits.
fresh," There is much about which to make sport in the American democratic process, and much of it is covered here, but not consistently well, and with little originality."
fresh," The film does a good job balancing and, in a few cases, overlapping the virtual and real worlds - though anyone from the future will tell you that you don't run down a street wearing VR goggles."
fresh," As ludicrous and as unfocused as it all might be, Kong: Skull Island kept me amused for practically every second of its two-hour running time."
rotten," The film's chief misstep is taking its title too literally, and ultimately depicting Louie as an indestructible, and thus largely inhuman, superhero."
fresh," A furious, pared-down parable enriched by the Polish director's sardonic understanding of man's desperation forever alternating between prey and predator. "
rotten," The Express eventually reaches its triumph-of-the-human-spirit climax, but it yanks too hard on the heart strings during the long journey there."
rotten," Alas, excesses of any pleasurable kind are absent from this exasperatingly dull production."
fresh," Refreshingly, Mol doesn't play Page as a dumb bunny but as someone who discovered that narrow middle ground between sweetness and sexiness."
fresh," It's all very environmentally minded and terribly worthy, but a bit of a slow-moving slog, and utterly devoid of any moistening drop of humour."
rotten," The results are tedious, talky and self-important. "
fresh, Amy Schumer is a force to be reckoned with - but despite some belly laughs Trainwreck doesn't quite transcend the romcom formula like the best of the genre.
rotten," We get that Anna and Jacob care for each other, but the foundation for their devotion often feels insubstantial if not imaginary."
fresh, Comedian Dane Cook provides the real surprise here in a brave performance that more than holds it's own amongst the list of great talent involved.
rotten," Inevitably, the movie spends a lot of time getting ready for the climactic showdown. But it's so chaotic and protracted as to lose much of its punch."
fresh, Blackkklansman is the best Spike Lee film in years. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten, The latest Melissa McCarthy star vehicle that fails to do justice to the sheer awesomeness of its leading lady.
rotten, ...wince-inducing in the extreme...
fresh," 30 Days is a proficient, atmospheric fangfest that does nothing you haven't seen before but still does it passably well."
fresh," It is hard to think of another actor who could bring off Don Juan De Marco, as Johnny Depp has. With his voice like a caress and eyes that gently preen, he is entirely believable as a consummate seducer, who yet remains sweet and sincere."
fresh, This is a film that could well earn a cult following. There is little visual flash to the story but it is an accomplished technical mystery. 
fresh, Good action helps an otherwise old-fashioned action thriller from Hong Kong veteran Ringo Lam. 
rotten," It seems to be offering a rather simplistic take on postwar grief and reconciliation: when forging bonds with the people of a former enemy nation, start with someone you fancy."
fresh, A monumental treat.
fresh," Despite the director, the film is damned wonderful"
rotten," [The film] is clearly anti- ""destroying the economy"", but isn't terrible coherent otherwise."
fresh," Sally Potter's twin interests - in grand world movements and in the grand internal movements in people lives - are effectively brought to bear in ""Ginger & Rosa,"" her best film of the decade."
rotten," The leads are appealing but the best scares will be familiar to anyone who has seen the previous films - or, for that matter, the trailer."
fresh," A student of the Steven Soderbergh school of filmmaking, it has the propulsive slickness of that director's best films, without ever feeling derivative."
fresh," Attempts to wed a '30s-style workplace screwball comedy with a misty-eyed World War II drama and, save for a few patchy spots, mostly succeeds."
fresh, Frances Ferguson is somehow able to find the funny when it comes to a substitute teacher misappropriating her power of authority.
rotten, ...a slightly too serious period costume drama
rotten," Familia gang is not, and never will be, the best of mexican cinema. It's a prefabricated product to a niche market. [Full review in Spanish] "
fresh," No slouch, but despite director McG's laudable efforts, number four doesn't improve upon the first three."
rotten," The frights aren't frightening, the political subtext never connects with the rest of the movie, and even Guadagnino's generally unfailing visual sense isn't enough to put this over."
rotten, My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 sits there like a potted plant in the center of a bundt cake: mildly amusing but mostly useless.
rotten, Marshall would be a better fit for an Andrew Lloyd Webber adaptation. I can't think of anything meaner than that to say about anyone.
rotten," [The film's female protagonist] isn't empowered to address her familial dispute; rather, it is ultimately left to the male, non-Muslims around her to fight her cause."
fresh, I was left with a greater understanding and appreciation of his work.
rotten," In what should have been dropped like a steaming bowl of kung fu yung at the first story session, screenwriters Stephen J. Rivele and Christopher Wilkinson instead put the romance front and center, dealing a death blow to the film's forward momentum."
fresh," By the time Gravity concludes at the end of its ninety minutes, we are exhausted. The filmmakers have convinced us that we are part of what we are witnessing, making for one of the most tense and intense movies imaginable."
rotten," Oh, the small-town/suburban horror of it all."
fresh," The big payoff to the Twilight saga is a solidly mounted, carefully directed exercise in franchise box-ticking... Even the decapitations are done tastefully."
fresh," The film's poignant music (composed by Khyam Allami) embodies this dualism with sounds and styles simultaneously traditional and modern, joyful and outraged, and hypnotic and sobering."
rotten," Dylan ... favors loud sound, loud images, loud everything -- only the laughs are muted."
fresh, Call 300 the New Age sword-and-sandal epic -- a Hercules movie for the computer age.
fresh, We can thank Chastain for making Molly's Game as watchable as it is. 
fresh, Too episodic but benefits from crackerjack acting and lush period photography.
rotten," It's not conventionally a good movie; there's little plot to speak of, and 83 minutes of psychedelia becomes a touch repetitive. However, it's still a captivating curio."
fresh, It's no classic but Troy does prove to be a damn good film overall.
fresh, Well-written (albeit a little too long) and competently acted.
rotten," A full scale Godzilla movie with the sort of quality special effects that the Japanese could not afford to lavish on the film was, at least for me, an exciting idea. Unfortunately, this was not the film I was hoping for."
rotten," ""The Second Mother"" goes soft toward the end, defusing its conflicts too easily and inconsequentially."
fresh," It is a slight romantic comedy given heft by the excellence of the two leads, and smartly scripted by writer-director Nicole Holofcener."
fresh, The Hurt Locker is the finest movie yet about our war in Iraq.
fresh," While I wish it had been more solid in its story, I still like the movie and recommend it. There's enough here that's great to offset the shakier stuff."
rotten, There is a strange and sometimes wondrous intensity in Cage's performances in these films; sometimes his madness is enough to elevate a film - like Werner Herzog's The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans - to a kind of trashy sublimity.

rotten, The dull romance between Sadie and Ben is revealed as little more than a prop for the comedian's patented schtick.
fresh," Its story is far from logical, let alone realistic, yet we laugh and completely buy into the fun."
rotten," Early on, [Downey Jr.] remarks that his goal is to understand how and why a person can go from Juilliard to the streets. If only The Soloist had the same intent."
rotten, Yudin's decision to opt for a wide-ranging collection of shallow portraits sabotages any chance of learning something meaningful or profound about these men.
rotten," Dies a horrible death in the second half, which is a crying shame when the opening is so strong and uniquely disturbing."
fresh, It was just portraying this one friendship and it did a great job. I love both lead performances and the script is excellent.
fresh," ...needs serious editing to at least take out the irrelevant wife story and to explain the incomprehensible heist better...Even so, it's a fun film to watch with excellent tension, and holds your interest throughout."
fresh," If ""Exhibition"" lacks conventionally developed characters and dialogue, it is visually enthralling."
rotten," The story is no bigger in the new version, which goes on for 117 minutes. And it's certainly not better."
fresh," Although not nearly as good as director Quentin Tarantino's previous effort Pulp Fiction, is nonetheless a solid, albeit overlong, exercise in filmmaking."
rotten," Given the amount of Botox on display, would a little Viagra have hurt?"
rotten, Clear proof that the series has long since surpassed its days of glory.
rotten, Funny? Maybe. Not to me.
fresh, The fact that it's the funniest movie I've seen this year is mindblowing.
rotten, A patronizing response to every question about Queen music that can be answered by either playing a Queen song or showing a clip of a band member discussing a Queen song.
rotten," I would admire the atmosphere a lot more if it amounted to something scary, creepy or original."
fresh," With its beautiful camerawork and coy, subtle humour this is filmmaking at its finest and most articulate."
rotten," What it lacks in laughs -- there are none -- it tries to make up for by ladling on stale clichés, such as Vardalos' two stereotypically gay assistants and a desperate younger female friend who stalks guys."
fresh," Finally cushions its harshest emotional blows, though Brendan Gleeson's deeply sad, stoic dignity in the lead cuts through some of the padding. "
rotten," At nearly two hours, the film feels endless."
fresh, Caine gives a gravely dynamic performance... but it's a role well within his usual range.
fresh," The Devil Wears Prada is a clear case of able actors elevating an ordinary script, a movie that's as entertaining to watch as it's easy to predict."
rotten," ""Paper Towns"" is a case where the supporting characters are more likable than the two young leads."
fresh," As with all of Egoyan's films, ""Adoration"" is a forward-thinking exploratory work of cinema meant to invigorate audiences into social discussions beyond its narrative structure."
rotten," ""Raging Bull"" it ain't -- it's not even ""Rocky IV."""
rotten, There's ultimately too much chaos and not enough control in Chadwick's presentation of Mandela's decades-spanning history.
fresh, That's right. In a film that feels about 20 minutes too long you don't get to the money shot for almost two hours! And with that much time to kill you may find yourself dreaming of a few martinis - be they shaken or stirred!
fresh," 'The Dark Knight Rises' tries to be very dark and serious. The problem is, that rubber-headed costume just looks sort of, well, comical, when things get too realistic."
rotten, Studio Executive 1: I want more money. Let's make an unnecessary sequel.
rotten, A film that doesn't know if it's comedy or parody. [Full Review in Spanish]
fresh," Screenwriter Michael Arndt, his dialogue getting the necessary backing by the excellent ensemble cast, manages to adroitly mix up the expected comic shtick with moments of great clarity and insight."
rotten," Might make a good skit on ""SNL"" but as a full movie - no way!"
rotten," It's basically Rosemary's Baby, Cajun style, with a pinch of Amityville Horror for kick."
fresh," Denzel Washington plays a villain for the first time ever, and his electrifying performance is the film's most powerful element."
fresh," A huge and satisfying meal of a movie. Like, six courses worth."
rotten, A film bedevilled by its intellectualism.
fresh," It would be nice to learn more of the original riders who inspired the challenge, but - as the title implies - it's an entertaining (if not hugely insightful) ride."
rotten," This atrocity is even worse than the 2004 version, if such a thing is possible,though I have to grudgingly admit that while it is as foul, vile and stupid as all get out, it is still somewhat better than the Dolph Lundgren version."
fresh," John Wick was made by first time director Chad Stahelski, who came into the industry as a stuntman. His expertise in that area obviously came in handy with this."
fresh, It's a very sad film and very well done.
rotten," If bare-knuckle fights are what you seek, director Ekachai Uekrongtham certainly delivers."
rotten, Zimmerman has effectively drowned any brainpower in a kaleidoscope of sloppy edits and relentless rolling footage of a man who appears to be profoundly boring.
rotten," Routinely blatantly nonsensical, the action is so plentiful, you'll feel like you've been grabbed by the back of the neck and dragged through the picture."
rotten, It feels more like an exercise in defining the mechanics of suspense than in actually utilizing them.
rotten, Where's the ambition? Where's the passion?
fresh, The genre-smashing Idlewild brings welcome new life to the familiar.
fresh," ""It starts very well, and we're immediately drawn into this world of dead pregnant teens, the Russian mob, the hermeneutics of tattoos and the archetypal disappointment of a father with his son."""
rotten," Moderately illuminating in parts, but the clichÃ (C)s of cinematic suffering tend to overwhelm it."
rotten, It displays all the intellectual heft of a beer commercial -- light beer at that.
rotten," The Ward, Carpenter's first feature since 2001's Ghosts of Mars, has the logy, diffident attitude of a lost artist."
fresh, The act of watching this lovely film is much like losing oneself in the pages of an enthralling novel. A cozy blanket and a steaming cup of hot cocoa are optional but nevertheless recommended.
fresh," Bol Bachchan carries off its rapidly thinning, virtually villain-free plot thanks to its fast-paced presentation of a storyline that hinges on a succession of double identities and escalating fabrications."
fresh," Despite those objections, the film still has a certain pull and engagement factor, and Ronan is as good as usual.(Full Content Review for Parents - Sexual Content, etc. - also Available)"
rotten," John Michael Higgins is disturbingly shrunken a la Lord of the Rings. How does the Actors' Union of Little People, if there is such a thing, feel about this?"
fresh," The movie's essential ingredients are simply two good actors, a lab compound, surveillance cameras and an eerie forest that may be driving the characters mad."
rotten, Robert De Niro is having sex with Carla Gugino. I know. It's like witnessing a traffic accident where an Edsel keeps slamming into a shiny red Corvette.
rotten," Moviegoers of a certain age are eager to see themselves reflected on screen, no matter how banal that reflection looks. "
rotten," In the movies, as in life, timing is everything. In the case of The Giver it's a movie that's several years too late."
fresh," Despite its formulaic filmmaking and redundancies, Ray can be a blast to watch."
fresh," Hard to describe and even more difficult to categorize, A Prairie Home Companion is a head-scratching delight full of charms and idiosyncrasies guaranteed to stand the test of time."
rotten," It ain't a pretty sight -- in fact, it's downright barbaric."
rotten," The film fits the terms of pastiche, but they never work and are never enhanced. [Full Review in Spanish]"
fresh," There is not one wasted shot in this arty film, nor one that is not a design student's delight... [the camera] gets down on the floor and shows us the dust swirling around a pair of boots and under a door."
rotten," The animation in The Good Dinosaur retains all the ambition and boundary-pushing of Pixar's best films, but the story beats echo too many predecessors to feel fresh, and the script feels unfinished."
rotten, It squanders both its source (the book is better-realized and more politically pointed) and the goofball interplay between its actors.
rotten," On the little screen, the eye is not discerning enough to see the obvious miniatures and shoddy special effects. It's all magnified by the big screen, as are the comic-strip lines put into the mouths of the wooden actors."
rotten," Not quite a romance by numbers, Prime is nevertheless a movie we need like a hole in the head."
rotten," The film is intended to be a romantic comedy. But its flat direction, stock punch lines, insipid musical numbers and suffocating swarm of characters make it horrifying."
fresh, Riveting and incredibly entertaining...
rotten," Elektra, who has a troubled past like several of Marvel Comics' superheros, is a challenge for filmmakers. While I respect their efforts, I can't recommend the result."
fresh," This isn't about heroic firefights or gung-ho speeches. Instead, it plays out like an astonishingly realistic horror movie as these genuine heroes edge their way through an old Russian minefield to save their comrades"
rotten, The movie lacks any semblance of a dramatic pulse.
fresh," ""Green Room"" sustains a bleak intensity unrivaled in recent thrillers - or horror movies, for that matter -- that gains potency from its pure plausibility."
fresh, Director Ken Kwapis coaxes convincing performances out of his youthful cast.
fresh, The premise is strong enough to sustain interest even though the drama lacks emotional intensity and edge-of-the-seat suspense.
rotten," This sibling revelry smackdown sting defeats its own elaborate cinematic narrative scheme, by failing to take itself seriously when ensuing dramatic events scream for it to do so."
fresh," The Theory of Everything offers interesting characters and standout acting. I wish it had delved deeper into its characters, but for what it is -- a romance involving one of the great minds of humanity -- it's engaging and moving."
fresh," If you think the yakuza is bad, just look at the cops."
fresh," In modern parlance, all that can be said of Fury is that it is what is: a brutally basic war picture."
rotten," Eventually, Hollywood plot machinations rear their ugly heads, dictating a generic Romeo-and-Juliet love story and an even staler cautionary tale about the evils of drugs that completely stifle the film's laid-back appeal."
rotten," A giant ad for stuffed toys and plastic figurines, Shark Tale's best suited for the smallest human fry, moviegoers who'll watch anything that's colorful and in motion."
fresh, An absolutely compelling portrait of a man of faith immersed in a fugue of existential anguish. 
rotten," [The] movie, though, has no wit, dark or otherwise; it's too sappy to be lean and mean."
rotten," Too often, it plays like a self-consciously high-minded riff on Crash."
rotten," At times 'The Goods"" gets up and running on all cylinders, but misfires often with bits that simply don't jell."
fresh," to know what those cowboy days of unregulated video were like... just look at the world wide web, whose content the state would no doubt also like to control and classify, if only it could afford to employ another billion or so examiners"
fresh," You know those Garry Marshall ensemble comedies like Mother's Day and New Year's Eve, where various strangers' lives intersect around a particular theme? Dog Days is like that, only not terrible."
fresh," Another in a line of original and unique films that [Brie] Larson makes her own, delivering one of the most layered and heartbreaking performances of the year."
fresh," The next time someone bemoans 'They just don't make 'em like they used to,' buy them a ticket to My One and Only. Sometimes they do, and sometimes they make them better. "
fresh, It does not mind raw emotion as long as it is delivered beneath a shimmery smooth veneer. Any and all medicines are accompanied by spoonfuls of sugar.
fresh," It's a quietly powerful film about redemption that works on multiple levels, thanks in part to its superb performances."
fresh," To say that there are no easy answers to planetary woes is to state the obvious. But the film seeks to reveal rather than lecture, in the hope that our eyes will convince our brains to act before it's too late."
fresh, Doctor Who: Shada is an unforgettable story in this 2017 version... [Full review in Spanish] 
fresh," Endearing family drama, offering generous dollops of Ozu-like wisdom for dealing with the mundane."
fresh, David Fincher brings depth and beauty to a supreme slice of genre-bending pulp fiction.
fresh," Disguised as a gross-out comedy simply in order to get made, it's a heartfelt portrait of living in our own skin."
rotten," Danes, as usual, overplays her character's every emotion."
rotten, The movie feels more like it's stalling for time rather than filling itself with humanity and redemption.
fresh," Small, smart girls may justifiably love The BFG. And boys? There's always the Rube Goldberg-esque scene in the Palace where fizzy farts burst free from all assembled, from giants to Queens, to the strains of a squad of bagpipers. "
rotten, An oddly muted comic-book fable that treads a fine line between ridiculous and profound.
fresh, It's a full throttle creepshow with the year's most delirious and stunning visual effects.
fresh, This amiable Ghostbusters knockoff is unusually competent for a Sandler comedy.
fresh, Costner's funny and sincere in a role that winks at his many previous baseball movies. And Joan Allen brings home the kind of performance that wins awards.
rotten, There's not enough invention or material for 91 minutes of this and the only performance that feels particularly inspired here is Maya Rudolph who works her usual 'how-is-she-this-hilarious?' magic.
fresh," Herding all these characters together into one big super-pileup required a gifted traffic cop; and Whedon, as we now see, was the ideal man for the job. "
rotten," Many fine ingredients--not least the performances of Aniston and Barraza--have gone into making this 'Cake,' but it leaves one wishing that the end result had been more uncompromising. "
fresh, Couple these sound effects and voices with some remarkable pictorial images and the consequence is a horror picture with an extraordinarily delicate and sensuous quality.
rotten," It is not, by and large, a very inspired film, though sometimes it gets there in spurts."
rotten," Far be it from me to deny that girls just want to have fun, but I hope they realize that once this latest teen idol fad has run its course, a mighty, mortifying hangover most surely awaits."
fresh," You're left shaken with sorrow for the characters, and slowly filled with respect for them all."
rotten," Perhaps the most dubious comedy franchise in movie history, ""Little Fockers"" takes another hobbling step toward cinema infamy. "
fresh," Oren Peli in his feature debut has a few jolts in store, and the natural performances of the cast and the aura of reality provided by the video format keep the tension high."
fresh," The first-time director, Doug Pray, doesn't linger long on anything, but the movie is so crisply and intelligently edited that you never feel you're being rushed through it."
fresh," At the end of the day, Curse of the Witch's Doll fails to deliver on any real jump scares but finishes on a strong final act accompanied by a solid lead performance and interesting twist."
rotten," There's nothing in Huntsman to hold its pieces together. Everybody's acting up a storm, but nobody expresses any urgency or aspiration or desire - and, what's worse, none of those great actors have been given any memorable lines."
rotten, Race To Witch Mountain promises sci-fi but ultimately delivers lo-fi. Its themes are predictable and its look generic: this is one Race you may want to sit out.
rotten," Even at 98 minutes, the whole thing lasts way too long."
rotten, Ford has come up with a nifty way of exploring the enduring allure and troubling underside of the superhero myth. It's just too bad his own all-too-human powers aren't quite up to the task.
fresh, Wong's most accessible film and one of his best.
fresh," As radical a reinvention of the biopic as Todd Haynes' I'm Not There, Neruda is Larraín's most conceptual and also his most demanding film yet."
rotten, Some of us may remember Akiva Goldsman for his dual Razzie nominations (1997′s A Time to Kill and 1998′s Batman & Robin). This may be the year he wins.
fresh, A compelling and gripping declaration of the impact of words and the power it can build in and around a kingdom...
fresh," In spite of its silly attitude, the movie asks real questions about the tension between show business and artistic desire."
rotten," This insipid, staggeringly dumb entry from New Line stoops to unprecedented new lows likely to stun even the most jaded cynic."
fresh," What could have been a blindly reverent biopic, and/or a tediously respectable prestige picture, instead at least tries to deal with the issues it raises, and tries to do so with with some subtlety and grace."
fresh, As sweet as it is tart.
fresh," Despite a limited setting, Möller makes the most of his drama, keeping the action tense due to a powerful story and a tremendous performance from lead actor Jakob Cedergren. "
fresh," Silent Hill starts out at point A and then goes so quickly, loudly and visually over-the-top that it flies completely off the rails into its own glorious weirdness."
fresh, An irresistibly engaging documentary that might be described as a lab experiment in art history presented with Las Vegas-style showmanship.
fresh," If you're going to make a film about an extremist, it makes sense to tell the story using extreme or at least unusual techniques."
rotten, The fact of its hero upstages anything the plot can possibly come up with.
fresh," A smart, engaged film powered by an altogether remarkable performance by Jake Gyllenhaal, it is melodrama grounded in a disturbing reality, an extreme scenario that is troubling because it cuts close to the bone."
fresh, Fun summer blockbuster
rotten," Whatever future this series may have, A Good Day to Die Hard is its current nadir."
fresh, Makes you appreciate that there are still a few people out there for whom film is still a worthy artistic expression.
rotten," The movie is cheering, in its way, which is different from being good, exactly."
rotten, As emptily defiant as a bit of graffiti on the base of a dustbin.
rotten, The full-on goofiness is not reliably buoyant; this is an intermittently enjoyable but often choppy comic ride.
rotten, Quickly becomes a movie in which a lot of people you don't care about chatter away without saying anything.
rotten," ... the gimmick has grown a bit stale, and there is something a bit off about watching a pair of privileged white guys carp about their privilege. Even if the film is winking at this affluenza for comic purposes, it's still present."
rotten," The original documentary may have been predatory, but it captured something powerful, the face of failed optimism, the many meanings of the word ""spoiled."" Sometimes it's better to let strange be strange."
fresh," The ending makes us catch our breath not because it's so clever, but because there's so much to the film even without the final revelation."
rotten," With Fassbender a blank patsy in one corner, and Diaz and Bardem hot-blooded horror shows in another, none of the actors or characters of The Counselor ever seem to exist together ..."
fresh," The film stands as a powerful, emotional memorial."
rotten," Everything is so nearly real, down to the characters' hair fluttering in the icy wind, that it's uneasily surreal, the way that clowns scare tots more than they amuse them."
rotten," I'd call it a pointless endeavor, except now we might finally be able to pinpoint the source of Wilson's recent depression."
rotten, Think of it as one long worship service in the Church of Vigilante Justice.
fresh," Director Ken Kwapis has the right touch for this material, making pointed observations without spilling blood."
rotten," Despite the visual aspect, the action sequences are repetitive, timid, lacking ambition, interest and drama. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh," Arizona creates a sense of isolated, store bought Americana that represented safety for many of its country's citizens during the mid-aughts."
fresh," Whip It, Drew Barrymore's fledgling outing as a director, stars Ellen Page in an engaging, affirming tale that's more sk8r grl saga than hell-on-wheels ride."
fresh," Always at ground zero in the chaos is Rambo -- gloriously, inhumanly impervious to fear and danger -- whose character is inhabited by Stallone with messianic intensity."
rotten, this latest instalment feels like a rudderless ship of ice floating in tropical waters. 
fresh," All Cheerleaders Die mixes a dash of Mean Girls, a pinch of Bring It On, and a heaping helping of witchy horror to conjure one fun-filled dark comedy."
rotten," Pretty routine, pretty forgettable."
rotten, The whole purpose behind this remake seems to be the same one behind many horror films these days: to throw as many buckets of blood around on the screen as you possibly can.
rotten," Despite the campus setting, little about the story is intelligently designed."
rotten," It is supposed to be a heart-melter, but my heart stayed the temperature of a phial of liquid nitrogen left overnight on the surface of Pluto."
rotten, All Is Well should never have been made and no one should have to sit through the travesty that it is. Avoid at all costs.
fresh, Directors Martha Shane and Lana Wilson in this topical documentary ably tackle in a fair-minded and detailed way the controversial issue of third-trimester abortions.
fresh," The movie is loaded with various sorts of humor, from the absurd, to the grotesque to the underhanded satire on spy films. "
fresh," Built around long, unsparing takes that are scrupulously observant ... the movie makes clear the importance of employment as a means of not just economic but mental underpinning."
rotten," From A to Z, this is a poor man's imitation of that legendary classic, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid."
rotten, Instantly forgettable and decidedly twee.
fresh," The Matrix is fun. It's thought-provoking, especially if you are touched with a pinch of paranoia. It's loud, explosive and a movie science fiction fans will appreciate."
fresh, The movie offers good-spirited fun with a family tilt.
fresh," [A] brisk, stylish and extremely heartfelt portrait of Nas' rise from the housing projects of Queensbridge to the heights of hip-hop royalty."
fresh," In what has shaped up to be a great year for horror, Cam stands near the top of the year's best."
fresh, A stunning blend of life's grand and monotonous movements.
rotten, it's the supporting cast that takes control of the movie and makes the audience pay attention as best we can as Fast Food Nation falls apart
rotten, Like going to a football game and watching the players bring desks and paperwork onto the field. How boring is this movie? I've been more entertained by halftime shows.
rotten," De Niro puts so little into his performances lately, I think I work harder just sitting through them."
fresh," The film creates a deeply rooted sense of realism that contrasts the austere, surreal illustrations. "
rotten, ...it is one of the worst movies that I've seen this year...
rotten, Seems too raw -- unedited and undifferentiated.
fresh, A paean to diversity that proudly shows its colors. 
fresh," Vreeland's willingness to include painful as well as flattering details is what gives Love, Cecil its punch."
fresh, There is enough good and good-spirited about Evelyn -- beginning with the performances by Brosnan and Vavasseur -- to forgive its more treacly moments.
fresh, This low-budget bungle-in-the-jungle chiller has a lot of smarts and perception about its organic fear-inducing impulses than most of its creepy contemporaries with a higher profile.
fresh," It works. As a kid flick, as a legitimate comedy, as a worthy extrapolation from the original book. The rendering of Theodor Seuss Geisel's characters and worlds here feel remarkably lifelike and put rerecent live-action monstrosities to shame."
fresh," Part of the reason why it works so well is that you gradually realize there's something far more substantive going on, and that makes the bits that work hit even harder."
rotten," If the intriguing but ultimately derivative Kingdom of Heaven had arrived before these recent period epics, it may have stood a better chance of enthralling us. "
fresh," Bridge of Spies may be devoid of spectacle, but it is still full of wonder and well worth a watch."
fresh," Marked by subtle moments of epic silence and a unique structure, writer/director Christopher Nolan's ""Dunkirk"" is a timeless classic."
rotten," The sequel still isn't as good as the series is capable of delivering, but it's a mildly entertaining diversion that shows signs of improvement."
fresh," Based on a play by Tomohiro Maekawa, Before We Vanish-its Japanese title means ""Strolling Invaders""-may not be prime Kurosawa, and it's oddly uneven in tone, but it has an ease about it that's intensely engaging."
fresh, Wong Kar Wai's latest masterpiece is an erotic and visually stunning meditation on the confines of love.
fresh," Attack the Block strains somewhat to deliver a climactic moral, but the way it slyly shifts our sympathies to Moses and his crew (at the expense of another species, granted) without overplaying their deprivation puts more serious-minded indies to shame."
fresh, You can push the gas throttle through the floor-board and go the limit on this picture. It's a picture for every type of audience.
fresh, That a film this daringly austere exists in the marketplace is almost miraculous in itself.
rotten," This being a Woody Allen film, there's some pretty sharp dialogue. "
rotten," While there's something undeniably fascinating about the way ""Fairhaven"" repeatedly avoids predictable payoffs for portentous dramatic setups, narrative momentum is conspicuous by its absence."
rotten, I can only glean that Cavalcade's obscurity is owed largely to the fact that it's just not that great a movie.
fresh," I wish it had done more than just include lots of shots of people looking reverentially up in the sky, but it does open up some promising avenues for the series going forward."
rotten, Which stinks worse? The absurdly large pile of red herrings Gone amasses? Or the film's sub-Scooby Doo conclusion?
rotten," For a film about discovering your own journey, it sure sticks to the main roads."
rotten," A bizarre mix of exhilarating and reprehensible. Not good, bro."
fresh," ""Batkid Begins"" doesn't have answers for our many troubles, nor will it change the world, but it provides hope for humanity, and that's something we surely need to see more of right now."
rotten," This is the rare film that is memorable, affecting, and bad."
rotten," After the interval, the filmmakers throw all restraint to the wind."
fresh," It's one of the better action films of 2009 and, even without Arnold, this Terminator puts the series back on track."
rotten, Jane Austen would spin in her nearly 200-year-old grave at the crude and broad movie made in her name.
rotten," Given wide latitude by the hero's gift, the story floats waywardly all over the place and, though the fancy camera moves are impressive, the journey is unsatisfying."
fresh," Wistful nostalgia is a big part of Landline's charm. Luckily, we have [Gillian] Robespierre and [Jenny] Slate to make sure that it's brought to us with all the quirk (sometimes a bit too much), charm, and hilarity that's become their trademark."
rotten," Don't expect style or invention, much less satire."
rotten," When the ruthless, faceless power of the state finally asserts itself, what is meant to be a shocking climax merits little more than a nod and a shrug."
rotten, this mid-air thriller sees the director not so much soaring to the heavens as merely coasting along on auto-pilot.
fresh, A modern parable that's fun for the whole family with an uplifting message about the power of cooperation. Can I get an Amen?
fresh," Gosling anchors the picture, and Epps ... has a kind of grace, presence and knowingness that far more experienced actors struggle vainly to find."
rotten," As lovely as the movie is to look at (and the final scene is exceptionally wonderful), it's too oblique to concentrate its energies and sharpen its focus."
fresh," Simply taken as a broad character comedy, ""The Campaign"" definitely has its moments."
rotten," As disturbing as the film can be, at the end of the day one doesn't really take much away from it."
fresh," From her behavior -- from Rampling's acting, in other words -- we become aware that Kate has begun to question the very meaning of her marriage (which is to say, her life). Was it an illusion? A compromise? A deception? A settling? A mistake?"
fresh, The film is more of a mind-trip than I expected.
rotten," Look out, it's Porcupine Guy! His hugs are lethal! And there's ""Angel,"" who...flies around a lot with his shirt off."
fresh," An astonishing, subversive take on tired clichés."
rotten," Gentle and cute, chatty and smart, the film at least holds our interest, mostly due to the sheer charm of its cast."
rotten," You'll be jolted a couple of times, but these aren't scares that will stay with you. How about retiring ""based on a true story"" in favour of ""based on a good story""?"
fresh, ...worth pursuing.
fresh," A smart, beautifully acted character drama."
rotten, Manufactured out of old movie parts by people who either don't care or were just looking to make their next movie.
rotten," However intermittently funny Assayas's newest film may be, Non-Fiction seems strikingly bidimensional."
fresh, taps into the psychological terror that has been missing from a lot of modern horror movies
rotten," It will please no one, but at least it tried not to be dull."
rotten, Welcome to MSNBC ... the movie!
fresh," Scream 2 works primarily as a genuine film of fright and panic and only intermittently as burlesque, which is good enough."
fresh," It shows, rather convincingly at that, how drama and detailing can keep the audience glued to seats even if none of the actors mouth a single word."
rotten, This remake is interesting mainly for the chance to see top-flight acting talent labor over dialogue so leaden you could cast bullets from it.
fresh," While the film is definitely amusing and touching, it, for whatever reason, never quite grows into hilarious or moving. "
fresh," Reese Witherspoon may be at that precious and precarious point in an actor's career where she can do no wrong. I don't know if she's enjoying the ride, but I sure am."
rotten, the appeal of the movie doesn't go much farther than the concept
fresh, The film succeeds as an homage to human spirit in the most shattering of circumstances.
rotten," Grace Is Gone grabs on to a name, a war, and the metaphor-come-to-life of a theme park with rides going nowhere. And we, the people, are spun around and shaken for tears."
rotten, Impressively contrived.
rotten," Standard rogue copseeks-revenge story is more entertaining than most thanks to Mel Gibson's seething (and likely self-referential) turn as police detective Thomas Craven, who'll stop at nothing to bring down the corporate meanies who did in his daughter."
fresh," Magnolia is a jigsaw puzzle of a film that, unfortunately, once its final image takes shape, is far less compelling than the pieces from which it was fashioned."
rotten, Dullest film in series is still brutal and bloody.
fresh," There's no quick fix for a culture 'addicted to debt,' as one wag puts it in the film. But watching I.O.U.S.A. is a good place to start."
fresh," Luckily for President Taylor, Bauer is always in the right place at the right time with guns blazing against long odds."
fresh, The team responsible for the How to Train Your Dragon saga... ties up this trilogy by dazzling us for the last time. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh," Although uneven, the film certainly has its heart in the right place."
fresh," The best character in the special, and perhaps in all of Western literature: Yukon Cornelius, the greatest prospector in the world (Wahoooooo!). "
fresh," Sure, the movie is completely predictable down to the very last shot, but when everyone is jamming as well together as the cast and crew do here, it's easy to give yourself over to its groove."
fresh," It is a film that is happy to mock audience expectations of a comic book adaptation, while also being faithful to the traditions of the genre."
fresh, This film pioneers observational action moviemaking. It sensitizes you to changes in atmosphere that portend danger and convey hidden meaning while furthering the plot and the characters.
fresh," One of the best American films of the year, even if you do feel more impatient with McCandless than Penn seems to."
rotten," There's a glimmer of interest in the film's ideological contortions, but as a commercial action thriller this is inflated and sluggish."
fresh," ""Rango"" is proof that not all new animated films need to go the gimmicky way of 3-D."
fresh," Concerned citizens who also value glossy, high-end, high-minded docs will feel rewarded, if not a bit more frustrated by an epidemic of denial fueled by voices from the right."
fresh," A typically astute and funny reading of the foibles of human relationships, spiced up with a forgivably contrived comedic plot twist."
fresh," A fast-paced, comedically intense film which capitalizes on the energy and talent of not only the cast, but also the succinctly written script."
fresh," The film is a whole mess of things, but at heart it's a poignant character study of the divergent ways in which people experience and cope with tragedies, and a powerful reminder that those often have a blanket reach."
rotten, Nelson Gidding's adaptation of the Michael Crichton novel is too literal and talky.
rotten, It's banal to the point that kids at the film's New York press screening were apparently bored out of their minds.
rotten," The sequel is terrible and all my original criticisms for the first film still stand, but at least it's a more entertaining kind of awful."
fresh," Even if all these disparate genre elements don't always come together, the film exudes a sense of zaniness and breeziness that make it easy to watch."
fresh," Grashaw keeps us guessing... By the time the end arrives, we're as surprised as Edwin and Flake want their classmates to be."
fresh," Covering the action basics the Michael Bays of the industry have turned into dreary formula, Guys has enough on its plate to sustain the jokes and noogies, offering plenty of laughs, but little panache in the editorial department."
rotten," Gruelingly antiseptic... an exercise in the ill-paced, the redundant, and the flat-out boring."
fresh," Scenes build up seemingly without meaning, until it becomes clear who Jack's father has become, and you find yourself sympathizing with both sides. It's oddly profound for a movie that is so nakedly sloppy and self-important. "
fresh," This film imagines its viewers to be smart, possessed of a decent attention span and game for a challenge. It doesn't happen all that often."
fresh, Pixar heads under the sea and finds subject matter that couldn't be more perfectly suited to its vivid style of computer animation.
fresh, A story that slowly drifts away from the joyful tone it starts with to become the sad tale of a man who had everything and lost it. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh," A love-it-or-hate-it mainstream romantic comedy in that makes a frill-free connection with its audience, whether that audience wants it or not. There's nothing wrong with something that delivers belly laughs before striking at gut level."
rotten," Squeezes most of the life out of Carell's twitchy, oddball comedic persona."
rotten, ... gives a good effort but ultimately falls short at the finish line.
rotten," [The franchise] continues down the path its chosen, devolving from a thoughtful exploration of reality to just another effects-laden shoot 'em up."
fresh," Warm, heartfelt but decidedly wan."
rotten," This one is definitely one to skip, even for horror movie fanatics."
fresh," In a summer where the best flicks have been comic book adaptations or documentaries, it only makes sense to end on a high note like the very non-Crumb American Splendor"
rotten," Filled with tortured, manipulative shock scares, it teasingly provides a setup for yet another supernatural sequel en route to the DVD roster."
rotten, The worst you can say is that Ozon's simply trying all he can to get a rise. The best you could say is he's made a mildly incoherent mess that revels in its reckless upchucking of ideas.
rotten, A sequel that is competently made but ultimately aimless and ineffective.
fresh, Passes comic-book muster
fresh," Another compelling work from Tykwer, however unpleasant."
fresh, 'Martha' should earn new Olsen sister a cult following. 
rotten," The script is fatally stupid, most of the gags fall flat, the secondary characters add little, Hudson fails to make anything interesting out of the exasperated heroine, and the endless references to McConaughey's sexual prowess finally become revolting."
rotten, '71 makes so much effort to be suspenseful that it doesn't have much time to get into nuance.
fresh," Another Year, a terrific new Mike Leigh movie, assesses that moment in every thinking person's life when the question ""what now?"" exceeds physical survival."
rotten," The one thing Hollywood can usually be counted on to do when remaking old films, especially when dumbing them down, is to boost their action quotient, and these guys have failed to do even that."
fresh," Though fragmentary and a bit scattershot, I Don't Belong Anywhere could spark interest in a filmmaker who has been unfairly marginalized in some quarters."
rotten," The kindest word that comes to mind is ""undistinguished."" Unfortunately, it's also uninteresting and uninspired - as well as tedious, noisy, obvious, annoying..."
fresh, It is enjoyable on a certain level but the simplistic representation of these warm-blooded women cracking open the frigidity of the French middle class becomes a bit hard to swallow after a while
rotten," Muhammad Ali may have had the ability to float like a butterfly and sting like a bee, but Grudge Match can do no more than stumble around like a cockroach that's taken a direct hit from a can of Raid."
fresh," ""Knock Knock"" ends on a not entirely satisfactory note, but delivers a pretty mean genre wallop getting there (with almost zero gore)."
rotten," The acting, action and special effects are good enough, but the movie's two mismatched story halves just don't work together. It is like trying to paste the first half of 'Die Hard' onto the last half of '300.'"
rotten," A stagy, arty, and uncompelling account of the Welsh writer and his menage-y relations with his boozy Irish wife and his young Welsh girlfriend."
fresh," To Kill a King is no Man for All Seasons, that poem to destiny and betrayal, but it exudes intelligent energy. What emerges is a dark, noisy history lesson viewed through the filter of a power struggle that spirals out of control."
fresh, An assured debut with great performances and a wonderfully odd brand of British humour.
fresh, 'You are there' documentary chronicling just how quickly a civilization can collapse into chaos and revolution. 
fresh, The film proves not only a stirring look at education's potential to rally and invigorate but also a vital snapshot of contemporary rural America.
rotten," In true franchise fashion, the set design and action sequences are all fun to look at. Then again, that's all a mere façade for deep down, On Stranger Tides is entirely empty."
rotten, Doom is a standard science-fiction/horror film that threatens to be substandard before perking up considerably in its final half.
fresh, I marvel at the way Winterbottom and his actors have captured the essence of your garden-variety midlife crisis in this lively and often bitterly funny two-hour distillation.
rotten," Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz) is the figure least obviously dictated by the Woody Allen template. And for that, you are eternally grateful."
fresh," It's natural to be repelled by Jackson's commercial- and franchise-minded motives ... but, ultimately, he delivers escapist entertainment that functions as the cinematic equivalent of comfort food."
fresh," Magnolia knows that life's randomness can also produce hope, humor and love. And it shows that in ways that more calculated feelgood movies can't fathom."
rotten," I can see why Shyamalan was attracted to this material, but the results are clunky even by his recent standards."
fresh," I pretty much unreservedly loved The World's End, whose compact dramatic structure and steady flow of good jokes puts most mainstream American comedies-too often loosely bundled collections of hit-or-miss sketches-to shame."
fresh," An exciting and visually stunning film, one which perhaps holds too much to a familiar path, but which is undeniably thrilling."
fresh," In the exhilarating Casanova, giddy shenanigans effectively set off the dangerous, darker impulses of human nature."
rotten," While Halloween II starts out as a character study in post-traumatic stress, it's safe to assume that's not what most horror fans will be looking for. And though Zombie maintains the motif of nightmarish visions throughout, the movie eventually cha"
fresh," This is a rare film that looks at what it takes to create a globally dominant business, and what it costs as well."
fresh," David Fincher's smartly written, expertly told chronicling of the dawn of the Facebook era ... is just that compelling, that engrossing, that hard to resist. Kind of like a certain website I know."
rotten," It's sloppy, disjointed and rambling ... but given the level of empathy her collection of stories stirs, it can't be fully dismissed. "
fresh," Proceed with caution and tissues, and possibly wearing armor."
rotten," As in so many essentially childish movies, it's an actual child who's always the smartest pants in the room."
fresh, Even those moments that raise the eyebrows sky-high still have a weird integrity and determination skating under the surface.
rotten, Feeds off a tenuous U2 connection to give a not-very-interesting tale of a rock'n'roll failure a higher profile.
rotten, [The romance is] an awkward afterthought to an already sluggish adventure story.
rotten," Nichols doesn't quite have the confidence to honour the tauter, darker bent of his leanings, instead pushing the material more towards a hackneyed Spielbergian sentiment."
fresh, A gripping and harrowing dissection of two deluded souls.
fresh," Stephen Frears' spiffy comedy of manners about infatuation, envy, jealousy, and adultery."
rotten, It plays less like a movie Woody Allen truly needed to make and more like one he took on so he could get a little work in while vacationing in Rome. 
rotten," Like many games that captured the experience of a movie (Tomb Raider, Prince of Persia, Max Payne), adapting it back into a movie just makes it a mediocre version of the films that inspired it."
rotten, I'd rather have my head stuck in a vise than be forced to sit through another viewing.
rotten, An uneven and unimaginative sex comedy about small-town losers.
fresh," ...a rumination and an affirmation on the female lifeforce, and its evolution throughout the 20th century..."
rotten," It got the surreal look it wanted, but so what! The film was a soft crime story from start to finish."
fresh," Easily one of the films of the year; a must-see, and on the big screen, so you can't escape. You've got to just sit there, and squirm."
rotten," It's a folly and a failure, but an intriguing one - an ambitious vision from a tremendous filmmaker that, sadly, had too much going on with not enough to say."
rotten," Reitman usually has a sharp focus and a clear, almost satirical voice. Maybe that's why his wandering around in a sun-dappled New England melodrama feels so disjointed and unnatural."
rotten," What we get is a preponderance of sameness. A movie with one vibe that oversells itself and, eventually, overstays its welcome."
fresh," [Winding Refn is] inviting you into his sand-pit filled with glitter, lamé and diced organs and wants to pin you in your seat with bold and vigorous cinematography."
fresh," Though there is no action, there is vibrancy to the dialog that enthralls for the duration of the film."
rotten, plays like How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days crossed with Without a Paddle. 
fresh, Director Darren Aronofsky creates an eerie Eraserhead-like world that keeps the film compelling.
fresh," Unlike American Pie, it does not rely upon bawdy antics and bodily fluids."
fresh, I savored every frame and gorged on every sound (being a fan of '70s Bowie helps).
fresh," Doesn't just depict a quantum leap forward in human consciousness  it practically requires such a leap, on an individual scale, from the viewer."
rotten," The story is bad. It's confusing, poorly edited and just way too over the top and contrived."
fresh," A reasonably smart, imaginative spin on the 1939 MGM classic."
rotten, Bullock's on form in a film that takes a playful poke at political campaigning but stops short of anything genuinely insightful.
fresh, It's well-acted and quietly powerful without settling for easy solutions to its unique dilemma.
rotten, Woo's hysterically hyper visuals and boytoy gimmickry can't camouflage the emptiness of the enterprise.
rotten, Strangely remote and uninvolving on both emotional and spiritual levels.
fresh, I doubt that anyone who isn't well familiar with slasher movie tropes will completely understand all the jokes... but they should at least get a couple laughs out of it.
rotten," The winking Tom Six, who cameos as himself, knows exactly what kind of movie he's made."
rotten, Three playful yet thoroughly disposable experiments in short-form p.o.v. cinema.
fresh," Though the movie at times feels oddly unfinished (you wonder what Miranda Richardson, in a tiny role as an Oxford professor, is there for), it's artful and moving."
rotten," Yes, Streep is wondrous as usual, but her superpowers have been squandered here."
fresh, You can't go home again. But it sure is nice to visit.
fresh," Riding the perverse line between bizarre, awkward and darkly funny, this award-winning film follows the strange antics of three siblings brought up by their misguided parents in complete isolation from the rest of the world."
rotten," Bugsy Malone... but without the bubble guns... Affleck tippy-toes to reach the top shelf where classic movie epics are kept but comes up with only ""Once Upon A Time in Hahvad Yahd."" (Or just maybe, ""The Hatman."")"
fresh," Angelina Jolie shines in all of the action requirements of the film, but the lack of emotion detracts from the overall entertainment value."
fresh," Fassbender was compelling as Rochester in Jane Eyre, as Carl Jung in A Dangerous Method and especially as Magneto in X-Men: First Class, but it was his role in Shame that allowed him to most fully expose himself, in more ways than one."
rotten," A slight improvement over the 2008 original, which is not saying much."
fresh, What separates Miyazaki's animation from everyone else's is the way he imagines his worlds.
